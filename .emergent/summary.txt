The AI engineer started by clarifying the user's intent for a STRYDA-v2 fresh build to avoid modifying an existing complex application (v1). After confirmation, a minimal Expo React Native shell with three tabs (Chat, Library, Tools) was built, including placeholder UI and a stubbed chat API. Initial deployment revealed conflicts with a pre-existing Expo server, leading the AI to overwrite the main frontend directory with the new  content and adapt to 's file-based routing.

UI polish was implemented per user requests, introducing a dark theme with orange accents, a simplified chat screen with a large logo, and a concise tagline. Voice input with graceful fallback was added. Subsequently, a minimal FastAPI backend was introduced, providing  and stubbed  endpoints, with the frontend wired to use it via an environment flag and a fallback mechanism.

The latest major work involved integrating a RAG pipeline with Supabase and  into the backend. This phase was challenging due to persistent database connection issues related to usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build STRYDA-v2, a minimal, stable, chat-first app shell for iOS, Android, and Web using Expo React Native. It must feature three tabs: Chat, Library, and Tools. The Chat screen requires a STRYDA.ai header, a Hi Mike â€” how can I help? greeting (later simplified to a large STRYDA(ai) logo and a single tagline: Your on-site co-pilot for smarter, safer builds.), a scrollable message list, and an input row with a text field and a voice-ready mic button. The voice input needs graceful fallback if unsupported. Library and Tools screens are placeholders. The app theme is clean, light (later updated to dark with an orange accent ), with system fonts. Backend calls are initially stubbed, returning a canned response with a fake citation (NZMRM COP X.Y). User uploads, LLM/retrieval integration (beyond stub), payment, and analytics are strictly forbidden. Persistence is via GitHub and state checkpoint files ().

The existing application was eventually overwritten, and a minimal FastAPI backend was introduced with  and  endpoints. The  endpoint was later upgraded to include a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, connecting to Supabase Postgres (with  extension) and utilizing an  for embeddings and chat, with graceful fallback if the DB or LLM key is missing.

- **Voice Recognition (STT)**: Integration with Web Speech API or .
- **Environment Variables**: For API_BASE, USE_BACKEND, DATABASE_URL, EMERGENT_LLM_KEY.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Backend system for context-aware LLM responses.

<code_architecture>
The application structure is primarily split into  (Expo React Native) and  (FastAPI). The  resides at  and the  at .



-   : Configures Expo Router tabs, specifying , ,  and .
-   : This is the main entry for the  tab. It contains the large STRYDA(ai) logo, the single tagline Your on-site co-pilot..., and the chat input with the mic button. It was modified to simplify UI, remove old text, apply dark theme, and integrate voice input and the .
-   : Simplified placeholder screen for the Library tab, applying the dark theme.
-   : Simplified placeholder screen for the Tools tab (originally named 'work'), applying the dark theme.
-   : Defines the application's color palette, including , , ,  (), and . Used consistently across UI components.
-   : Contains the  function that now uses  to call the backend  endpoint, with a fallback to a local stubbed response on network errors or backend issues.
-   : A fetch wrapper responsible for making HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads and handling timeouts.
-   : Manages environment-specific configurations like  and  flags, read from .
-   : The main FastAPI application. Implements  endpoint and  endpoint. The  endpoint orchestrates the RAG pipeline using , , and  modules, with graceful fallback.
-   : Handles PostgreSQL (Supabase) database connections and  for vector similarity search.
-   : Wraps embedding and chat completion calls to an external LLM (via ), including error handling.
-   : Constructs system and user messages for the LLM based on query, context chunks, and history.
-   : Orchestrates the retrieval process: embeds the query, searches the vector database, and returns relevant content.

This structure allows for clear separation of concerns between frontend UI, backend API logic, and RAG components.

<pending_tasks>
- Correct the Supabase  format to use the correct username (e.g., ) to resolve the Tenant or user not found error.
- After successful database connection, ensure the  table schema (with  index) is applied in Supabase.
- (Implicit) Ingest actual data into the Supabase  table for the RAG system to provide real answers.

<current_work>
Currently, the STRYDA-v2 application has its frontend (Expo React Native) fully developed with a dark theme, orange accents, a simplified chat screen featuring a logo and a single tagline, and a voice-ready input (with graceful fallback). The minimal FastAPI backend is also set up, including a RAG pipeline that integrates with Supabase for vector search and an external LLM using  for text generation.

The immediate work involves debugging the database connection between the backend and Supabase. While DNS resolution issues were resolved by identifying the correct Supabase connection pooler hostname, the current error is FATAL: Tenant or user not found. This indicates that the username part of the  (currently ) is incorrect for the Supabase pooler, which expects a format like . The LLM client is confirmed to be initialized and working, but the RAG system falls back to a canned response due to the database connection failure.

<optional_next_step>
Correct the  in the backend to use the proper Supabase pooler username format ().
