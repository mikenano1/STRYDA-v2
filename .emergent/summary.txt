This trajectory details the development of STRYDA.ai, an AI-powered mobile assistant for NZ builders. The initial phase focused on building an MVP with a dark-mode Expo UI, tab navigation, and a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, and an early LLM integration.

Key achievements include the **complete integration of the NZ Building Code**, processing a 1.57MB PDF into over 2,230 documents and 4,200 chunks, making the AI production-ready for compliance queries.

The project then tackled a **comprehensive product database** via EBOSS.co.nz scraping. Initial scraping efforts faced timeouts, which were successfully resolved by adding proper HTTP timeouts, error handling, and refined scraping logic. The EBOSS scraper has successfully integrated over 2,433 products.

Following this, **OCR product scanning** was implemented, creating a camera-based system using  and  for on-device text recognition, seamlessly integrating with the EBOSS product database for instant product identification and compliance.

A significant redesign of the **Library tab** transformed it into a hierarchical product catalog, fulfilling user requests for trade-based filtering, brand categories, and detailed product views without EBOSS labels. Frontend access issues (white screen, frozen app on Expo Go) were repeatedly troubleshooted, primarily due to ngrok conflicts and Metro bundler issues, and successfully resolved.

Currently, the AI engineer is implementing **Vision AI integration (GPT-4O)** to enable diagram reading within the chat, and has just started integrating the image upload functionality into the frontend.

<product_requirements>
STRYDA.ai aims to be an AI-powered mobile assistant for NZ builders, offering rapid, cited building code guidance. The initial MVP required a dark-mode Expo UI, tab navigation (Home/Work/Library), a core chat interface with AI integration via a Universal LLM Key, and web scraping for NZ building documentation.

Implemented features include a functional mobile app, a FastAPI backend with MongoDB for chat/job management, an AI chat system now powered by real NZ Building Code (NZBC) data, and an Enhanced Document Processing system using ChromaDB for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), intelligent chunking, and a web scraping framework.

Current strategic priorities include:
1.  **Complete NZ Building Code Integration**: Full NZBC text, NZS Standards, council requirements, and historical versions (Achieved).
2.  **Comprehensive Product Database**: Integrate specifications, installation guides, and compliance data for thousands of NZ building products from manufacturers via web scraping (e.g., EBOSS.co.nz). The goal is to obtain over 5,300 products, systematically, one brand at a time.
3.  **Advanced Product Intelligence**: Implement product finding via OCR scanning from photos/labels, including the ability to read and explain diagrams within PDFs, and link them to chat responses for detailed visual guidance.
4.  **Specialized Trade Focus**: Expand knowledge for electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and structural engineering standards.
5.  **Refined User Experience**: Enhance the Library tab with hierarchical navigation (Trades -> Brands -> Categories -> Products -> Details), clean product names, advanced filtering, and a favorites system. Simplify the Ask AI button and streamline bottom navigation tabs.

The STRYDA.ai application is a sophisticated mobile-first platform. The frontend features a professional dark-mode UI with a 3-tab navigation (Home, Work, Library). The backend is powered by FastAPI, integrated with AI via the Emergent Universal LLM Key, and leverages a ChromaDB vector database for RAG.

A major accomplishment is the **complete integration of the NZ Building Code**, allowing the AI to provide expert-level, cited responses. The **EBOSS Product Database** has been successfully integrated, overcoming initial timeout issues. The scraper has successfully processed and stored **2,433 products** from various brands, with the capability for further expansion.

**OCR Product Scanning** has been fully implemented, providing a camera-based system for on-device text recognition, enabling instant product identification against the EBOSS database and compliance analysis.

The **Library tab** has been completely redesigned into a hierarchical product catalog, fulfilling user requirements for trade-based filtering, brand-specific product categories, detailed product views, and a favorites system. Redundant EBOSS labels have been removed from product displays. Frontend access issues with Expo Go (frozen app, white screen, ngrok conflicts) have been repeatedly troubleshooted and resolved, with the app now fully accessible and interactive via .

The Ask AI button text has been simplified to Want me to source something specific for you for this product?.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in **Phase 1: Vision AI Integration**. The backend endpoint  has been added to  to enable GPT-4O diagram analysis.
