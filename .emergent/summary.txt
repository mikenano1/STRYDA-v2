This trajectory details the STRYDA.ai project's evolution, managed by an AI engineer. Initially, an MVP was built with a dark-mode Expo UI, tab navigation, and a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a basic LLM integration. The project then shifted to enhancing the AI's brain with RAG via ChromaDB, intelligent chunking, and web scraping frameworks.

The core recent work focused on integrating the **complete NZ Building Code**. The AI successfully processed a 1.57MB PDF, creating 2,126 new NZBC documents and 4,217 chunks, significantly expanding the knowledge base and enabling the AI to provide detailed, cited compliance answers. The system was declared production-ready for this functionality.

Following this, the focus shifted to building a **comprehensive product database** by scraping EBOSS.co.nz, with a subsequent plan for OCR product scanning. The AI has completed an in-depth analysis of the EBOSS site structure and begun implementing the scraper, but encountered a timeout during the initial testing phase, which is the current state of work.

<product_requirements>
STRYDA.ai is envisioned as an AI-powered mobile assistant for NZ builders, providing fast, reliable building code guidance with citations. The initial build required a dark-mode UI, tab navigation (Home/Work/Library), core chat, and AI integration using a Universal LLM Key, along with web scraping for NZ building documentation.

Implemented features include a functional mobile app, FastAPI backend with MongoDB for chat/job management, initial AI chat with NZ-specific guidance (now with real NZBC data), and an Enhanced Document Processing system utilizing ChromaDB for RAG, intelligent chunking, and a web scraping framework.

Current priorities, post initial MVP, are:
-   **Complete NZ Building Code Integration**: Full NZBC text, NZS Standards, council requirements, and historical versions. (Achieved)
-   **Comprehensive Product Database**: Integrate specifications, installation guides, and compliance data for thousands of NZ building products from manufacturers via web scraping (e.g., EBOSS.co.nz).
-   **Advanced Product Intelligence**: Product finder via OCR scanning, compatibility checking, cost comparison.
-   **Specialized Trade Focus**: Expand knowledge for electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and structural engineering standards.

<current_work>
The STRYDA.ai application currently boasts a fully functional Expo React Native frontend with a professional dark-mode UI and a 3-tab navigation (Home, Work, Library). The FastAPI backend is robust, integrated with an AI via the Emergent Universal LLM Key, and leverages a ChromaDB vector database for RAG.

A significant recent achievement is the **complete integration of the NZ Building Code**. The AI successfully processed the , expanding the knowledge base to over 2,100 documents and 4,200 chunks, allowing the AI to provide expert-level, cited responses on various building code queries. This system was thoroughly tested and confirmed to be production-ready for Building Code inquiries.

The immediate ongoing task is the **EBOSS Product Database Integration**. The AI has completed an extensive analysis of the EBOSS.co.nz site structure, identifying categories, brands, and pagination for efficient scraping. A new module, , has been created, and  has been updated with corresponding API endpoints (, ). Dependencies () were added to . A test script, , was created and executed, but it **timed out** after 2 minutes without providing a conclusive success or failure message. The current state is that the EBOSS scraping system has been set up, but its functionality is unconfirmed due to the timeout.
