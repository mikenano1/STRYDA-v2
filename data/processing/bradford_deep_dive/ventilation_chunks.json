IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTE: The number of vents required should be rounded up, not down, to ensure that the ventilation provided meets or exceeds the recommended requirement. For example, the ventilation requirement for a 10\u00b0 pitched roof 20m long in the longest horizontal direction is calculated as follows: \u2022 The ventilator requirement (1 per 12.5m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended WindMaster spacing of 12.5m = 20/12.5 = 1.6 vents which should be rounded up to 2 WindMasters, to be evenly distributed along the roof. \u2022 The metal eave vent requirement (1 per 1.4m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended metal eave vent spacing of 1.4m = 20/1.4 = 14.2 eave vents which should be rounded up to 16 metal eave vents, evenly distributed around the roof.

IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTE: The number of vents required should be rounded up, not down, to ensure that the ventilation provided meets or exceeds the recommended requirement. For example, the ventilation requirement for a 10\u00b0 pitched roof 20m long in the longest horizontal direction is calculated as follows: \u2022 The ventilator requirement (1 per 12.5m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended WindMaster spacing of 12.5m = 20/12.5 = 1.6 vents which should be rounded up to 2 WindMasters, to be evenly distributed along the roof. \u2022 The metal eave vent requirement (1 per 1.4m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended metal eave vent spacing of 1.4m = 20/1.4 = 14.2 eave vents which should be rounded up to 16 metal eave vents, evenly distributed around the roof.

IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTE: The number of vents required should be rounded up, not down, to ensure that the ventilation provided meets or exceeds the recommended requirement. For example, the ventilation requirement for a 10\u00b0 pitched roof 20m long in the longest horizontal direction is calculated as follows: \u2022 The ventilator requirement (1 per 1.4m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended Roof Valve BAL Static spacing of 1.4m = 20/1.4 = 14.3 vents which should be rounded up to 15 Roof Valve BAL Static Vents, to be evenly distributed along the roof. \u2022 The metal eave vent requirement (1 per 1.4m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended metal eave vent spacing of 1.4m = 20/1.4 = 14.3 eave vents which should be rounded up to 16 metal eave vents, evenly distributed around the roof.

IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTE: The number of vents required should be rounded up, not down, to ensure that the ventilation provided meets or exceeds the recommended requirement. For example, the ventilation requirement for a 10\u00b0 pitched roof 20m long in the longest horizontal direction is calculated as follows: \u2022 The ventilator requirement (1 per 3.5m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended Roof Valve Static spacing of 3.5m = 20/3.5 = 5.7 vents which should be rounded up to 6 Roof Valve Static Vents, to be evenly distributed along the roof. \u2022 The metal eave vent requirement (1 per 1.4m) is calculated as follows: 20m divided by the recommended metal eave vent spacing of 1.4m = 20/1.4 = 14.2 eave vents which should be rounded up to 16 metal eave vents, evenly distributed around the roof.

Q: Is the roof orientation important for the SolarXVENT? A: Yes, to maximise the amount of solar energy that the SolarXVENT can collect and use, the SolarXVENT should be installed on a northern facing roof which is not shaded by trees. Installation in other directions or onto a roof that is frequently in shade will reduce the operating time of the product. Q: Can I duct the SolarXVENT? A: Yes, with a suitable collar the SolarXVENT can be ducted. Accessories for ducting SolarXVENT can be purchased from Bradford. Call for further details. Problem Possible Causes/Actions Cause - Solar panel is in shade. System not running Action - Wait until the next day - Check seal where the flashing has Water leaks when raining been installed against the roof 13",

This mode runs continuously on a low power setting day and night to provide ventilation of heat and moisture in the roof cavity. For more information on how many Maestro BAL and eave vents are required to satisfy the National Construction Code via Performance Solution please see Page 7 of this product manual. If the Maestro BAL is not required for new-build NCC2019 compliance, the Bradford Air iQ smart box can be activated by holding down the 'Mode Button' for at least 5 seconds. *Important Note* The default setting of 30% motor speed must not be changed if using the Maestro BAL to meet the National Construction Code. If this setting is changed, it cannot be reactivated. Once the Bradford Air iQ Smart Box is activated the order of modes are: LO. MED. HI, AUTO. When engaging AUTO mode the fan will activate to full speed and then slow down to a stop to provide feedback that AUTO has been selected. Once this startup procedure is complete the fan will analyse the environment and run at the appropriate speed.

    "content": "2. VENTILATOR POSITIONING & PROVISION FOR MAKE-UP AIR CSR Bradford Ventilation recommends that ventilators are positioned 4m to 6m away from each other in all directions for effective and efficient performance. It is also recommended that ventilators of the same size are used together to prevent replacement air from being drawn between ventilators of different sizes. Ensure that the ventilators are not sheltered from the wind by surrounding objects, the shadow angle created by the roof ridge or by each other. Make-up air is required for this ventilator to replenish the exhausted air. As a general guide, the largest make-up air entry should be positioned on the opposite side of the building to the largest ventilator demand. The make-up air location should be positioned at optimum height to provide efficient sweeping of the floor area. The illustrations below provide a number of generic ventilator and make-up air layouts but it should be noted that a whole-of-building assessment, as per AS1668.2, should be conducted by a suitably qualified person prior to deciding upon site-specific ventilator and make-up air placement. IMPORTANT: If external make-up air is insufficient, the ventilators will draw make-up air from each other \u2013 this will both diminish the effectiveness of the system and increase the risk of the system drawing external water into the building during periods of rain.",

The building owner or manager is responsible for outlining the maintenance program throughout the product\u2019s lifespan based upon the site-specific application and environmental conditions. As a general guideline, this product should be inspected at least once every 12 months, with adjustments made according to the site-specific conditions. The following components should be inspected on a regular basis: WARNING: Prior to inspecting the ventilator ensure that the power is turned off and that the ventilator head is held in a static position by another person using a gloved hand on the top surface of the turbine (away from the turbine blades) \u2013 this should not be undertaken on a windy day when the turbine head cannot be safely slowed. \u2022 Rotating/turbine head \u2013 check for excessive movement/contact between components, unusual noise during rotation, listen for noises and assess visual wear & tear. \u2022 Fasteners \u2013 check all are in situ and well-sealed. \u2022 Flashing Connections \u2013 check joints that are meant to be sealed remain sealed and that those that are meant to be unsealed are clear of obstruction. \u2022 Pestguard (if provided) \u2013 ensure this is clear of debris. \u2022 Electrical component and connections \u2013 check connections for wear or exposure damage. 6.",

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE No Failure Mode / Potential Cause(s) Image / Description 1 Issue: Water or rain leakage Potential Cause: Varipitch connection not sealed. Action: Seal Varipitch connection with flexible, weatherproof sealant. Additional Information: The photo in the sidebar shows the possible outcome if the Varipitch connection has been slightly separated during angle adjustment or has not been sealed. 2 Issue: Water or rain leakage Potential Cause: Ventilator throat gutter blocked. Action: Remove blockage \u2013 refer drainage diagram in these instructions Additional Information: Placing sealant around the bottom of the vent throat where it contacts the flashing blocks the vent gutter at the base of the throat, preventing the release of internal condensation and mist from the inside of the throat. 21 The contents of this install guide are copyright protected and may not be reproduced in any form without prior written consent of CSR.

IMPORTANT: It is recommended that the ventilator be installed along the 3rd or 4th row of tiles from the ridge. Lower positions will return lower vent performance and increase the risk of leakage in heavy rain. The installation higher than the third row of tiles down from the ridge may damage the ridge tile pointing and is NOT recommended. STEP 2 Position the flashing in the desired location so that the tiles that need to be cut or removed can be determined. Ensure bot- tom edge of the flashing passes the lower tile edge which will be folded later to form a seal. Mark-out the position to either remove and/or cut the required tiles. Depending on roof construction, a tile batten may be obstructing the throat opening of the vent. This batten can be left in place with the ventilator sitting above it. 3",

An in-house design connection box is installed to enable the easy fi t of a CAT 5e cable. 4. TEMPERATURE SENSOR VARIABLE SPEED CONTROL: The temperature sensor is factory pre-programmed to power up at 27\u00b0C, as measured by the temperature in the throat of the ventilator, then follow a speed ramp up rate which is established by setting a full speed maximum temperature at 40\u00b0C. Alternative temperature range, can be specifi ed at time of purchase.

    "content": "In a world first, EcoPower\u00ae is the only hybrid ventilation unit which incorporates Australian-engineered True-hybrid technology. Hybrid ventilation is defined as a \u201ctwo mode (or multi-mode) system that is controlled to minimise energy consumption, while maintaining acceptable indoor air quality and thermal comfort\u201d*. EcoPower\u00ae hybrid ventilation will work to ensure a constant supply of fresh air. It combines natural ventilation with a high efficiency electronically commutated (EC) motor in a single unit to ensure reliable and on-demand peak performance, when required. EcoPower\u00ae is capable of operating unhindered in natural mode (wind), or in both natural and energy efficient mechanical modes simultaneously. When required, performance is boosted by activating mechanical operation to ensure desired airflow rates are achieved. Even during mechanical operation, wind power can improve flow rate performance. EcoPower\u00ae installed at Bradford Seven Hills, NSW, Australia. *Source : Luther, Mark and Chen, Zhendong 2002-2011, Emerging Technologies in Ventilation, BEDP Environment Design Guide.

For a system without filters, the NCC 2015 Section J 5.2a, states \u201cwhen the air flow rate of a mechanical ventilation system is more than 1000 L/s, the system must have a fan power to air flow rate ratio\u201d of 0.65 W/(L/s). In comparison, EcoPower EP900 have a fan motor power to air flow ratio of 0.0864 W/(L/s). This equates to an energy reduction of 86.7%.

    "content": "PROJECTS AND APPLICATIONS AUDITORIUMS, HALLS AND GYMNASIUMS Large spaces with high occupancy usage load are often accompanied by excess heat build-up. In many cases, natural ventilation is not adequate during times of high usage periods. EcoPower allows demand controlled ventilation to significantly increase the rate of extraction. This delivers better airflow control, improved occupant comfort and reduces the load on air conditioning systems. Aquatic centre INDUSTRIAL, FACTORIES AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES EcoPower can be configured and programmed to automatically respond to set temperatures and/or humidity using Air iQ control platform or 0-10V inputs to your Building Management System (BMS). Applications include meat and dairy processing plants, refrigerated warehouses, dry goods storage and data centres. Factory CLASSROOMS When ducted to the ceiling, EcoPower allows natural ventilation during the day to meet or exceed minimum outdoor air ventilation rates requirements of AS1688.2 and ASHRAE standard 62.1. The powered mode can be activated at night, by a timer or temperature sensor. The night purge operation removes excess heat in the room or building, allowing cool night air to cool the building down. This reduces air conditioning load and lowers energy consumption. Classroom 10",

    "content": "Why Choose Power Driven Ventilation Our power driven vents are smart and powerful, boasting best in class performance for residential homes in bushfire and non-bushfire applications. When Air iQ is activated, AiroMatic or Maestro BAL can intelligently detect the level of heat and humidity in the roof space and regulate their fan speeds accordingly. With a max speed of up to 880m\u00b3/hr^, they can outperform almost all other residential vents on the market within the same categories. This means most homes will only require 1 power driven vent to effectively ventilate their roof. Less is more with Bradford Ventilation. Did you know that 1 Maestro BAL or 1 AiroMatic * is equivalent to 4 WindMaster Vents? 4 WindMaster Vents 1 Maestro BAL Vent = ^ 880m\u00b3/hr for Maestro BAL, 647m\u00b3/hr for AiroMatic. * At pre-fixed speed setting, when combined with the recommended number of evenly distributed eave vents to provide replacement air.",
