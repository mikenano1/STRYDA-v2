The first is to determine whether the proposed building complies with the requirements set out in this Manual (Building Check), and the second is to determine whether the site complies with the requirements set out in this Manual (Site Check). Note: NZS3604 provides for parts of buildings to be considered as individual buildings. These flow diagrams apply to those parts of the building where slab-on-ground is being considered and where the part of the building can be considered as an individual building under NZS3604.

    "content": "5.4 Design Example For Lateral Resistance Calculation The following is a short example to demonstrate the process of determining whether shear piles are required. Consider a 180m2 single storey home with a light roof located in Palmerston North in a VH wind zone as defined by NZS3604. Assume the building height is 6m with 3m above the eaves. The length for across wind considerations is 15m and the width (along wind) is 12m. First consider seismic actions. From Figure 6. the seismic hazard factor is 0.4. Since this is less than 0.45 shear keys will not be required for earthquake resistance. Now consider wind loading. Table 5.5 of NZS3604 requires 95 bracing units per meter (BU/m) across the building and 90 BU/m along. As it\u2019s a very high wind zone these figures need to be increased by a factor of 1.3. The BU demand for across building wind is therefore = 95 x 1.3 x 15 = 1853BU The BU demand along the building = 90 x 1.3 x 12 = 1404BU From Table 4. for a single storey light weight roof with 1.5kPa live load the capacity is 1630BU per 100m2. Therefore for 180m2 the capacity is 2934BU. As the capacity (2934) is greater than the demand (1853) no shear keys are required. If the demand had exceeded the capacity then any shortfall can be provided by supplying shear keys in accordance with Section 5.3 with each shear key providing the BU specified in Section 5.2. 6.0 OTHER DESIGN DETAILS 6.1 R-Values The insulation performance of a building element is measured by the \u201cR-Value\u201d.",

Recent revisions to clause H1 of the Building Code has significantly changed the method used to calculate the insulation values of slabs supported on the ground. The most significant change being that the ground is now assumed to have a default thermal conductively of 2 W/(m.K) (more conductive than previously assumed) and modelling of the floor units are conducted in accordance with ISO 13370. The information provided in the R Value calculator has been developed using method described in H1/VM1. A further subtle change is that the way the area to perimeter ratio is calculated (A/P ratio). H1/AS1 defines this as: Where w equals the horizontal distance between the slab edge and the interior surface of the wall. The acceptable solutions for H1, provides 3 methods of demonstrating compliance with the Building Code requirements. These being: \u2022 The schedule method \u2022 The calculation method \u2022 Modelling using H1-VM1 H1 now splits New Zealand into 6 climate zones. Compliance by the schedule method involves providing a solution with a calculated R value in excess of the minimum scheduled value for the relevant climate zone.

    "content": "6.5 Services Detailing Two options exist for running services, both of which are appropriate, however some regional Building Consent Authorities and builders have clear preferences. The options being within slab, or under slab. Experience from the Christchurch earthquakes shows that the most seismically robust solution is for services to run within the plane of the pods (within slab). 6.6 Within Slab Running of Services Pipes services can be run within the plane of the pods either exiting out of the side of the perimeter ring beam or going under- ground at the edge beam. Pipes shall be laid at a fall to comply with NZBC G13/AS1. For pipe up to 65mm diameter the minimum gradient is typically 1 in 40, while for 100mm pipes it\u2019s 1 in 60, however greater falls may be required dependent upon the required number of discharge units. Table 5. provides distances from the edge of the slab to pipe surface penetration to achieve minimum pipe gradients. A 300mm pod alternative is often used where the proposed positioning of the service means minimum required gradients cannot be achieved. Where gradients cannot be achieved with a 300mm pod, then services will require to be run under the slab. Pipes shall be located to pass perpendicular to the ribs and beams and shall not be laid along the length of ribs or beams. Pods are cut as required to achieve the required fall and position. Pipes shall be laid to ensure 15mm concrete cover between pipe and reinforcement in the perimeter beam.",

(2) Where a gas pipe line runs through the RibRaft\u00ae floor system, in addition to the requirements above, the pipeline shall enter the building through the outside face of the perimeter foundation beam, be concrete encased and located in the plane of the pods. The aim being to ensure that damage to the gas pipe will most likely occur outside the building envelope should movement occur between the ground and RibRaft\u00ae in a large earthquake.

The joints shall be lapped not less than 50mm and sealed with pressure sensitive tape not less than 50mm wide. All penetrations of the DPM by plumbing and services or punctures during construction shall also be sealed with pressure sensitive tape. The DPM may extend beyond the edge of the slab i.e. underneath the formwork, or may be folded and stapled up the inside of the formwork. The minimum requirement is that the DPM extends to the outside of the edge beam. It is very important that the DPM is not bunched up at the formwork. 2.6 OPTIONAL GRAVEL RAFT The RibRaft\u00ae X-Pod\u00ae flooring system can sit directly on the soil, where ground bearing conditions permit although a sand blinding layer may be required to provide puncture resistance to the DPM. Where ground conditions are soft, a compacted gravel raft can be provided to reduce the bearing pressures in the natural ground to acceptable levels.

An evaluation of whether expression of liquefaction ejecta is likely at the surface should be conducted for systems sited in TC2 liquefaction zones (refer MBIE guidelines (3) for TC2 classification). The aim of this being to minimise the potential for liquefaction ejected entering the voids of the X-Pod\u00ae system. Isihara(11) found that where the depth to the water table is 3m the presence of sand boils are rare. For sites such as these, no specific mechanism for reducing the ingress of liquefaction sand into the X-Pod\u00ae voids would be required. Where the water table is closer than 3m to the surface, Van Ballegooy(12) suggest that the Liquefaction Severity Number (LSN) provides a good indication of the expression of liquefaction ejecta at the surface. Specific geo-technical advice should be provided, however it is suggested that based on the LSN in the Ultimate Limit State: LSN 0-20 Little or no expression of liquefaction is expected, therefore there is no need to consider methods of preventing ejecta entering the voids.

Recent revisions to clause H1 of the Building Code has significantly changed the method used to calculate the insulation values of slabs supported on the ground.

The information provided in the HotEdge R-Value calculator has been developed using method described in H1/VM1. A further subtle change is that the way the area to perimeter ratio is calculated (A/P ratio). H1/AS1 defines this as: ( A ) A slab,internal slab area to perimeter ratio = P P slab,internal Alternatively, where external dimensions are known the following can be used: Where w equals the horizontal slab area to perimeter ratio ( A ) = A slab,external - W d e i d s g ta e n a c n e d b t e h t e w e in e te n r t io h r e s s u la rf b a ce of P P 2 the wall. slab,external The acceptable solutions for H1, provides three methods of demonstrating compliance with the Building Code requirements.

Pipes services can be run within the plane of the RibRaft\u00ae X-Pod\u00aes either exiting out of the side of the perimeter ring beam or going underground near the edge beam. Pipes shall be laid at a fall to comply with NZBC G13/AS1. For pipe up to 65mm diameter the minimum gradient is typically 1 in 40, while for 100mm pipes its 1 in 60, however greater falls may be required dependent upon the required number of discharge units. Table 1 provides distances from the edge of the slab to pipe surface penetration to achieve minimum pipe gradients. Where gradients cannot be achieved, then services will be required to be run under the slab. Pipes shall either be: 1 Located to pass perpendicular to the ribs and beams and shall not be laid along the length of ribs or beams. X-Pod\u00aes can be cut and sealed as required to achieve the required fall and position. 2 The adjustable X-Pod\u00ae can be used to create beams to run services through.

The level of reinforcement provided in a RibRaft\u00ae X-Pod\u00ae flooring system mean that cracks have no structural implications being only an aesthetics issue. Factors to consider are the type of floor finish, the location of ribs and ground beams. When warm sunny days are followed by cool nights, the change in temperature can cause cracking. Hence preference should be given to using early entry saws which are used immediately after finishing. Shrinkage control joints cut using diamond blades shall be cut as early as possible which is typically within 24 hours of hardening in summer, and 48 hours in winter. They shall be cut to a depth of 25mm. Shrinkage control joints do not guaranteed to eliminate all visible or unwanted cracks. Joints shall be positioned to coincide with major changes in floor plan. Where concrete is to be exposed, for example in a garage, or brittle covering placed over, the maximum intermediate bay sizes shall be limited to 5m.",

Where concrete is to be exposed, for example in a garage, or brittle covering placed over, the maximum intermediate bay sizes shall be limited to 5m. Bay dimensions formed by shrinkage control joints shall be limited to a maximum ratio of length:width of 1.5:1. Where a shrinkage control joint runs along the line of a load bearing rib, then the joint shall be located directly above one edge of that rib. In order to limit the width of cracks at re-entrant, or internal corners, extra steel is often specified and is placed on top of the mesh. These are typically 2-HD12 bars (grade 500E), 1200mm long tied to the top of the mesh at 200mm centres, with 50mm cover to the internal corner \u2013 refer Building Consent drawing for details. 3.11.2 FREE JOINTS For large plan areas the designer may specify free joints. These are typically joints which allow unrestrained movement, but are doweled to prevent vertical movement. If specified then follow details shown on the building consent drawings. 14 FIRTH RIBRAFT\u00ae X-POD\u00ae INSTALLERS GUIDE",

    "content": "3.12 FINISH EXPECTATIONS The Building Amendment Act 2013 introduced new consumer protection measures which became effective on 1 January 2015. MBIE has developed guidance to the industry on what constitutes a defect and the definition of acceptable/ unacceptable defects. The MBIE guidance document suggest that for a concrete floor it is recognised that some cracking in concrete is common and not necessarily a sign of poor workmanship. The document suggests that cracks up to 3mm wide are acceptable. It is also recognises that the levelness of the floor is important. NZS3114 requires an even plane within \u00b15mm for every 3m direction for a carpeted floors and \u00b13mm for tiled and vinyl floors. Individual mounds should be less than 3mm high and depressions less than 3mm deep. In additional no abrupt deviations greater than specified in NZS3114 should exist. Visible reinforcing or bony concrete should not exist along the slab edge. Concrete is a natural material and shade variation can be expected. Often slight colour variations will fade with time. 4 INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION When requested, the installation contractor shall provide a PS3 for the installation of the Firth RibRaft\u00ae X-Pod\u00ae floor. Confirming that construction was in accordance with the project drawings and that the concrete used for the project was supplied by Firth Industries. 15 FIRTH RIBRAFT\u00ae X-POD\u00ae INSTALLERS GUIDE",

For placing and finishing guidelines refer below and to CCANZ\u2019s posters number 3 and 5. 1 It is generally preferable to start pour at the garage (allows a harder, flatter finish) and work away. Controlling the flow from the pump nozzle is important to ensure even coverage. 2 Follow behind pour face with immersion (spud) type vibrator to all concrete (beams, ribs and top slab). 3 Care must be taken around plumbing to ensure damage, or movement does not occur. 4 Following vibration, normal concrete finishing techniques shall be carried out (refer poster number 5).

Two types are described here, saw cut joints (which are tied joints) and free joints. 3.11.1 SAW CUT JOINTS Saw cuts are located at positons in which the concrete is likely to crack due to stresses induced by restrained shrinkage. The aim of providing them is for the concrete to crack at the bottom of the saw cut thus minimizing the potential for a visible crack wandering over the surface. The level of reinforcement provided in a RibRaft\u00ae X-Pod\u00ae flooring system mean that cracks have no structural implications being only an aesthetics issue. Factors to consider are the type of floor finish, the location of ribs and ground beams. When warm sunny days are followed by cool nights, the change in temperature can cause cracking. Hence preference should be given to using early entry saws which are used immediately after finishing. Shrinkage control joints cut using diamond blades shall be cut as early as possible which is typically within 24 hours of hardening in summer, and 48 hours in winter. They shall be cut to a depth of 25mm. Shrinkage control joints do not guaranteed to eliminate all visible or unwanted cracks. Joints shall be positioned to coincide with major changes in floor plan.

MBIE has developed guidance to the industry on what constitutes a defect and the definition of acceptable/ unacceptable defects. The MBIE guidance document suggest that for a concrete floor it is recognised that some cracking in concrete is common and not necessarily a sign of poor workmanship. The document suggests that cracks up to 3mm wide are acceptable. It is also recognises that the levelness of the floor is important. NZS3114 requires an even plane within \u00b15mm for every 3m direction for a carpeted floors and 33mm for tiled and vinyl floors. Individual mounds should be less than 3mm high and depressions less than 3mm deep. In additional no abrupt deviations greater than specified in NZS3114 should exist. Visible reinforcing or bony concrete should not exist along the slab edge. Concrete is a natural material and shade variation can be expected. Often slight colour variations will fade with time. 4 INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION When requested, the installation contractor shall provide a PS3 for the installation of the Firth RibRaft\u00ae X-Pod\u00ae floor.
