    "content": "INSTALLATION / LAYING GUIDE 1. SETTING OUT & DRAINAGE Set a string line to a height to correspond to the finished level of the pavers, making allowance for the various depths of the basecourse, bedding sand and paver thickness. The top surface of the paving needs to have slope or fall so that rainwater runs off and does not pond on the surface. Allow for a fall of at least 25mm per metre and ensure any paved area falls away from buildings. A paved area must have a sufficient number of drainage collection points i.e. (channels, kerbs and cesspit sumps) to collect the rainwater and discharge it to a suitable stormwater disposal system. Depth of excavation = thickness of paver + 20mm bedding sand + thickness of basecourse 2. EXCAVATION & SUBGRADE All organic material e.g. (vegetation, topsoil etc.) should be removed and the soil excavated down to a depth allowing for the thickness of basecourse, bedding layer and pavers. At this level, otherwise known as the subgrade, the soil needs to be assessed for strength. It is important that the subgrade is of uniform strength, so any soft, loose material or existing fill areas will need to be undercut, removed and replaced with dense compacted material. Measure down from the string lines using a tape measure to check the correct level of the subgrade has been reached. The subgrade will need to be shaped and trimmed accurately. It is desirable that the subgrade slopes to prevent ponding of water at that level.",

It is desirable that the subgrade slopes to prevent ponding of water at that level. If the soil is wet, then a drain may be needed that is piped to a suitable discharge position. 3. BASECOURSE The thickness of basecourse that is required will depend on both the strength of the subgrade soil and the type of loading anticipated on the pavers. Generally, 100mm to 150mm thick for residential driveways, and 50mm to 75mm thick for patios and pathways. Note: These thicknesses refer to the final compacted depth of basecourse and are a guide only. For more comprehensive recommendations, refer NZS 3116:2002 Table 2 Basecourse Thickness. The basecourse shall be a well-graded, granular material with durable particles, free from organic material. GAP20 or GAP40 aggregate are suitable materials. Spread, shape and thoroughly compact the basecourse to a uniform dense condition using a vibrating plate compactor. Dampen the aggregate whilst plate compacting to get the best result. It is VERY important to get the top surface of the basecourse to the right height and within tight tolerance for levels and falls. Do not rely on the bedding sand to compensate for any out of tolerance basecourse levels as the bedding layer will compact unevenly and in time will result in an uneven paved top surface.",

When setting out the base course allow an extra 150-170mm for the concrete haunching/kerb to sit on (see cross section D below).

The pavers themselves must be absolutely dry otherwise the sand will not fully make its way to the bottom of the joint. Note: For stabilised jointing sand products, it is important to carefully follow the manufacturers clean-up instructions otherwise discolouration marks may result on the surface of the pavers. Once the joints are full, and the haunching has set, cured and gained sufficient strength, compact the pavers using a suitable vibrating plate compactor. A vibrating plate compactor must NOT be used on larger pavers such as 400 x 400 Forum Pavers instead use a rubber mallet on these pavers. Good practice for normal pavers is to attach an old carpet to the plate compactor which prevents the surface of the paver from being damaged. During compaction, keep topping up the joints with sand as it settles until all joints are completely full. This procedure initially \u201clocks up\u201d the pavers. Sweep off any excess sand. At a later stage, once the pavers have had traffic on them, it may be necessary to return to the project to top up and completely fill the joints with sand. 7",

LAYING TIPS Colour Variation \u2022 When laying more than one pallet make sure to \u201cmix & match\u201d from different alternating pallets to blend the colour variation. Order all the paving together to reduce colour variation. Finished Paving Level \u2022 Keep the finished level of the paving below the damp proof course of your house in accordance with your local council requirements. 100 to 150mm depending on region. Haunching \u2022 Concrete haunching requires a setting (curing) period of 5 - 7 days before any traffic should be allowed on the paving. Avoid driving vehicles over the edge of the paving. Driveways \u2022 It is best to use darker colours in driveways as tyre marks and oil stains will not be as visible. Sealing of your paving helps to prevent the absorption of oils and aids cleaning when necessary. Minimising Joint Sand Loss \u2022 If the loss of joint sand is a likely (steep driveways), either sealing the joints or a stabilised jointing sand e.g. Dricon Pavelock, should be considered. Read product supplier instructions carefully. 11. FOLLOW UP MAINTENANCE AND SEALING Routine cleaning and maintenance of the paved surface is recommended. Periodic cleaning and removal of organic materials such as moss, mould and algae etc. using proprietary products and physical brushing with detergent rinsed off with water is suggested to maintain the appearance of the product. Most paving cleaning products are acid based and remove the surface of the paver.",

Most paving cleaning products are acid based and remove the surface of the paver. The depth of removal is dependent on the dilution of the acid.

Other environmentally friendly cleaning methods for killing weeds and moss: \u2022 Boiling hot water \u2022 Steam water blast \u2022 Flame (Propane torch weed burner) If staining or marking of the pavers is likely e.g., leaves, berries, BBQ spills, tannin staining from outdoor furniture then sealing your paved area should be considered. You can get specialist advice from sealant suppliers. Because it is difficult to remove stains, sealing should be carried out as soon as possible following installation. Make sure all efflorescence is removed by acid washing. Remember efflorescence is transparent when wet, wait for pavers to dry before you evaluate weather to acid wash or not. 8",

Persistent surface water or damp gound conditions of cement reacting with water, depositing crystals on the surface of the product. It can appear as whitening and is more visible on coloured pavers. There are some things you can do to minimise efflorescence such as keep paving covered and dry before laying and provide good drainage to the subgrade and basecourse. If efflorescence is left untreated for an extended period, acid washing or mechanical removal may be required. Please talk to a local sealing specialist for more information. We strongly recommend sealing pavers with a water based acrylic sealant. As well as increasing long term durability and colour retention, sealing reduces maintenance required for stains and cleaning. Honed pavers must be sealed once laid. All pavers are delivered unsealed. Firth recommends Dricon\u2019s range of Masonry care product to clean and help prevent efflorescence.

    "content": "3.0 PLANNING AND PREPARATION Before commencing installation, assess the nature of the project. In particular, consider how the paving will be laid in conventional terms, and how the Firth EcoPave\u00ae Range System will manage rain, stormwater & runoff. On large surfaces it may be necessary to get the system hydrologically engineered to ensure the pavement can manage the required runoff capacity from a water management point of view. Ensure that each of the following is understood & completed prior to the actual start of the job. 3.1 Locate and mark the area to be paved. 3.2 Verify the location, type and elevations of edging around the perimeter. 3.3 Excavate ensuring that the sub-base foundation is appropriate for the amount of traffic it will be subjected to. The required excavation depth for either the Detention or Infiltration system will need to be calculated based on a combination of Table 1 and the amount of water the system is expected to store (refer to section 2, for the storage capacity of the chosen base material i.e. Winstone\u2019s drainage aggregate or Firth\u2019s Enviromix 19mm concrete). Ensure the sub-grade (soil) is compacted to the specified density and moisture content. Note: Compaction of the soil sub-grade should be to a minimum of 5% CBR for pedestrian areas and residential driveways, and a minimum of 7% CBR for vehicular areas. Stabilisation of the soil and/or base material may be necessary with weak or saturated soils, or when subject to high wheel loads.",

Stabilisation of the soil and/or base material may be necessary with weak or saturated soils, or when subject to high wheel loads. Compaction will reduce the permeability of soils. These conditions may require the use of drains in open graded bases). On site sub-grade CBR can be determined by Scala Penetrometer Test as per NZS 4402:1986. 3.4 Once excavation is complete, ensure that the sub-grade is free from standing water, uniform and even. There should be no organic material or debris on the site prior to the start of the job. 3.5 Where necessary, it is acceptable to apply bedding sand immediately on top of the sub-grade (prior to applying the geotextile) in order to even out any undulations/holes on the surface of the sub-grade. 3.6 The site is now ready for installation. Note: A sloping site will have less storage capacity than a level site as water will resurface at the lowest point. This can be overcome by encouraging cross flow (through the installation of weirs) or concentrating storage capacity at the lowest point of the design.
