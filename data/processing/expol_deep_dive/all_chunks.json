Specific spacings between fixings or battens may need to be referenced from the detailed installation instructions, as they are not depicted in the provided text.\n\n3. **Assembly Order or Installation Sequence**:\n   - The installation appears to start with the masonry block as the base layer, followed by the attachment of wooden battens. Next, the insulation (ExPol Fastline) is fit between the battens, and finally, the interior lining is applied over the top.\n\n4. **Critical Details**:\n   - Overlaps are important where the ExPol Fastline sheets join to ensure thermal continuity. Minimum clearances between insulation and any moisture-prone areas should be maintained to prevent dampness. Specific gaps for ventilation may also be necessary based\n\nPage context: MaSonrY Wall Masonry Block Wooden batten inSulaTion eXPol Fastline Fastener Interior lining eXPol Fastline (Graphite Infused \u2013 Premium Expanded Polystyrene Sheet) is EXPOL\u2019s new generation high perfor",

Specific dimensions pertaining to different insulation board sizes may also be indicated.\n\n3. **Assembly Order/Installation Sequence**: The sequence of installation generally starts with framing (studs and dwangs), followed by the placement of insulation (ThermaSlab), installation of the cavity battens, and finally the attachment of the external cladding. The internal lining is installed last.\n\n4. **Critical Details**: Key installation details include:\n   - Overlaps at junctions where insulation boards meet, ensuring continuity.\n   - Minimum clearances between insulation and other materials to prevent moisture accumulation.\n   - Gaps may be required for thermal expansion and contraction, particularly at the junctions of different materials. \n\nThis concise technical description outlines critical aspects of the construction detail relevant to wall insulation systems.\n\nPage context: Wall Internal lining Dwangs inSulaTion Cavity batten Studs External cladding EXPOL provides high performance fire retardant solid insulation solutions eXPol thermaSlab for insulating timber and steel ",

The addition of graphite to Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) creates a product that offers one of the most effective forms of interior insulation available. Resistant to moisture, EXPOL Platinum Board is an excellent choice for wall cavities as it does not allow moisture to transfer from the exterior cladding to interior wall linings. Where superior R value, moisture resistance and flexible sizing is required, EXPOL Platinum Board is your best choice. __________________________________________________________________________________ 2.0 - Installation 2.1 There are no special requirements for PPE when handling or installing EPS.

This retardant inhibits the early stages of fire development. UV Light Expanded Polystyrene is susceptible to ultraviolet degradation if exposed to sunlight for long periods of time. Degradation caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight is generally surficial (yellow coloured dust) and does not cause detrimental property changes of practical importance. This discolouring can be removed by power washing or a grinder, if desired.

Buoyancy Because of its closed-cell structure and light weight, EXPOL GeoFoam is buoyant. Care must be taken during design, construction and postconstruction to ensure that the potential flotation forces are accounted for within the hydrological conditions of the site. Adequate surcharge, i.e., soil or pavement cover, or an alternate means of passive restraint must be provided against uplift. Alternately, the material can be installed above the water table or the water table can be lowered using suitable drains or other dewatering systems. Drainage (generally a sand or gravel layer) can be provided between the EXPOL GeoFoam fill and the natural soils to reduce potential uplift forces. Providing for adequate drainage of groundwater and/or surficial waters below the EXPOL GeoFoam prevents water from infiltration and reduces the development of uplift forces. Water Absorption EPS has a closed-cell structure that limit water absorption. When used in well-drained conditions, no change in EXPOL GeoFoam weight is expected over time. A slight increase in the weight of EXPOL GeoFoam can be expected over time due to water absorption if installed in a submerged application. For further technical information please contact us.

There are numerous design considerations for EXPOL GeoFoam applications. These considerations include engineering properties and construction factors. This section presents some of the advantages and unique features of building with EXPOL GeoFoam, as well as precautions that must be followed. Lightweight EXPOL GeoFoam is manufactured in various unit weights that typically range from about 12 \u2013 28 kilograms per cubic meter. As a result, they impart small dead load or stress to underlying soils, structures and utilities. This is especially advantageous where the existing soils are poorly suited to support additional loading (e.g., compressible clay, peats, etc.). In fact, existing loads can be significantly reduced by excavating and replacing native soils, which commonly weigh about 1.60 kilograms per cubic meter, with EXPOL GeoFoam.",

The use of EXPOL GeoFoam over existing utilities can eliminate the need for utility relocation. The use of EXPOL GeoFoam behind earth retaining structures, such as bridge abutments, can reduce lateral stresses. Strength EXPOL GeoFoam is available in a range of compressive resistances. A project designer can choose the specific type of Expanded Polystyrene required to support the design loading while minimising cost. Several different types of EXPOL GeoFoam can be specified on a single project to maximise savings. For example, higher strength EXPOL GeoFoam can be used in high applied stress areas while lower strength blocks are used in areas where the applied stresses are lower. EXPOL GeoFoam design loads are recommended to not exceed the compressive resistance at 1% capacity. This limit controls the amount of long-term deflection, or creep, resulting from permanent sustained loads. For further technical information please contact us.

Construction Time EXPOL GeoFoam helps projects maintain extremely tight construction schedules. The ease and speed with which EXPOL GeoFoam can be constructed results in shorter construction time because of faster placement rates, reduced utility relocation and less disruption of traffic in urban areas. Additionally, adverse weather conditions typically do not affect placement rates of EXPOL GeoFoam. Ease of Handling No special equipment is required when building with EXPOL GeoFoam. Blocks can often be carried and set in place by labourers or easily handled with mechanised equipment. This is an important consideration when the construction site is congested or does not have the clearances required for traditional placement or compaction equipment. EXPOL GeoFoam can be field cut using a hot-wire cutter, hand saw or chain saw. The EXPOL GeoFoam can be trimmed on site to accommodate the shapes of existing underground utilities and services. Construction Cost In addition to other project costs, using EXPOL GeoFoam reduces the loading on adjacent supporting structures. Adjacent structures can be designed to be less robust and therefore less expensive. This is particularly important for underground utilities.",

This is particularly important for underground utilities. Typically, the higher cost of some types of lightweight fill materials is usually offset by savings when all of the project costs are considered, such as lower installation costs and lower maintenance. Available in a range of compressive resistances, EXPOL GeoFoam allows for economical project design. Stability EXPOL GeoFoam is considered a permanent material when correctly specified and installed. Insulation Expanded Polystyrene is an efficient thermal insulator. Expanded Polystyrene has been used for many years as insulation for various building applications. Although some applications may not directly utilise the insulation value of EXPOL GeoFoam, this aspect should be considered in all designs. __________________________________________________________________________________ For further technical information please contact us.

Prevention of differential icing is a consideration when using EXPOL GeoFoam in roadway construction in cold climates. Differential icing is defined as the formation of ice on the surface of an insulated pavement, when the adjacent, non-insulated pavement remains ice-free. When constructed next to existing roadways, sections of pavement constructed over EXPOL GeoFoam can form ice prior to adjoining areas because EXPOL GeoFoam is an excellent insulator, which prevents heat from reaching the pavement from the underlying soil. One way to address this concern is to keep the top Sand-leveling course level of the EXPOL GeoFoam at or below the appropriate frost line for the region. For example, for a frost line of (0.9 meters), a minimum Geomembrane/separation layer separation layer and pavement system material thickness of (0.9 meters) should be provided over the EXPOL GeoFoam.

Although some EXPOL GeoFoam applications may not directly utilise the insulation value of EXPOL The stress at a compressive strain of 1% is called the elastic limit stress GeoFoam, this aspect should be considered in all designs. and is measured in a Standard rapid-loading compression test.
