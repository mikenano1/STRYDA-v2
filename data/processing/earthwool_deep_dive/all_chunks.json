It is recommended that this is installed at right angles to the existing insulation. \u25aa Insulation is available in varying widths and thicknesses to suit most framing spaces. Please check Knauf Insulation\u2019s product guide for the most suitable product for your application. \u25aa To calculate the number of packs needed, determine the area (m2) to be insulated by multiplying the length by the width or wall height. The number of m2 of insulation material is clearly marked on each pack. Divide the total area to be insulated by the m2 in a pack to determine the number of packs required (don\u2019t forget to round up to the nearest whole pack). Allowances should be made for areas that are unable to be insulated. STEP 2 \u25aa Don\u2019t take the insulation out of the packaging until you\u2019re in a position and ready to install. \u25aa Before installation, gently agitate the insulation by gently shaking or bouncing it on its side until it recovers to the thickness stated on the label. \u25aa Do not block ceiling vents and take care around downlights and other sources of heat. Consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for appropriate clearances. Additional guidance is provided in AS 3999 and NZS 4246.

It is important that when you cut the insulation that you avoid coming into contact with any electrical services. \u25aa When installing insulation in a roof eave (i.e. where the roof joins the ceiling), make sure the insulation covers the top plate but is not in contact with the roof. It is important to maintain a 20mm gap between the roofing substrate and the insulation. STEP 4 \u25aa Complete the final check of the insulation ensuring all areas have been insulated and that you have an even and consistent layer of insulation. \u25aa Finish your project by removing all packaging from the ceiling and disposing of all rubbish and excess insulation responsibly. STEP 5 \u25aa Once you have worked your way back to the ceiling access, make sure you insulate the ceiling access panel before exiting the roof space.

PROVEN PERFORMANCE \u25aa Preferred by professional installers concerned with quality, appearance and productivity. \u25aa Excellent acoustical properties reduce sound transmission in the home when properly installed. ELECTRICAL SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE ISOLATING POWER \u25aa Locate and review the incoming power supply, main switchboard and meter box. \u25aa Ensure you understand if there is a main isolator and how power can be safely isolated. \u25aa Ensure you understand the direction of the \u2018On\u2019 and \u2018Off\u2019 position of the main switch (NOTE: the \u2018Off\u2019 position is not always as it seems - check with an electrician if you are unsure). \u25aa Before installation, switch \u2018Off\u2019 the electricity supply at the main switchboard (check with an electrician if you are unsure if power can be turned \u2018Off\u2019\u2019 at the switchboard). \u25aa Be aware that even after isolating the power via the switchboard there may still be an electrical mains cable in either the ceiling or underfloor space that is live.",

Before you start installing, please make sure you are familiar with our Health and Safety Information contained in this document. Ensure that you use tools and equipment that are suitable for the intended application. This will include suitable safety equipment. DO NOT START WORK UNTIL THE SITE IS SAFE! Assess the underfloor condition and structure together with the method of installation you are to use based on the appropriate requirements established in the building code, site assessment and or plans provided. Installation must be completed to the requirements of relevant standard: AS 3999 or NZS 4246. When insulating any floors, care should be taken to ensure that sub floor ventilation is maintained according to AS/NZS 1860 or heed the recommendations of particleboard/timber flooring suppliers. Try and avoid staples made from metal or other conductive materials if possible. Installing underfloor insulation can be hazardous due to the working environment and electrical cables.

Take extreme care to avoid touching any live overhead electrical lines, supply cables or any other live cables in the workspace. \u25aa Defective electrical cables, exposed terminals and conductors of electrical equipment such as light fittings and fans can cause burns and electric shocks please exercise caution when working near such hazards \u2013 check with an electrician if you are unsure if the cabling is safe. \u25aa Working in hot and poorly ventilated areas when installing insulation can be dangerous. \u25aa Working at heights, when installing insulation can be dangerous. BEFORE INSTALLATION \u25aa You must turn the mains power \u2018Off\u2019 and, if in any doubt about how to turn the power \u2018Off\u2019, consult a licensed electrician. \u25aa Do not enter the workspace for the purposes of the pre-work inspection or the installation until you are satisfied that the power has been isolated. Even after isolating the power via the switchboard there may still be an electrical mains cable in either the ceiling or underfloor space that is live.",
