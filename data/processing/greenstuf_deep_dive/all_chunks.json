    "content": "S\u2019QAF NOITALUSNI GNIDNATSREDNU greenstuf.co.nz UNDERSTANDING INSULATION FAQ\u2019S CAN I INSTALL WALL INSULATION IN MY EXISTING HOME? Wall insulation is relatively difficult to install in an existing home as the wall lining or cladding needs to be removed first. Tackle this during renovations. HOW DO DOWNLIGHTS AFFECT INSULATION? There are a number of different downlights available in New Zealand. There is significant fire risk associated with downlights, so careful selection of bulbs and fixtures, as well as correct installation of the light fitting and surrounding insulation, is crucial. Only IC type downlights allow the insulation to abut and cover the luminaire. CA type downlights must not be covered by insulation. Minimum insulation clearances around un-rated downlights are required for all types of insulation, including polyester and fibreglass (glass wool), to reduce over-heating and the risk of fire. Please contact the lighting manufacturer or GreenStuf for more information on safe clearances. COULD MY HOT WATER CYLINDER BE COSTING ME MONEY? GreenStuf ECO Wrap\u00ae is an insulation wrap designed for older electric hot water cylinders. Thermally efficient water heating saves energy costs, and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) estimate that wrapping an older cylinder can save you up to $80 per year in water heating costs. If your hot water cylinder is warm to touch, it\u2019s losing energy.",

The R-Value is based on the product\u2019s ability to reduce The R-Value of insulation is the industry standard measurement of thermal resistance. The higher the R-Value the greater the performance. SHOULD I DOUBLE LAYER MY CEILING INSULATION? There are several different types of ceiling insulation. Segments or Pads are the conventional format for insulation products. These are installed snug between joists. Because they don\u2019t cover the ceiling joists you lose heat through \u2018thermal bridging\u2019 due to your joists having a lower R-Value than insulation. Insulation blankets can help avoid thermal bridging as they are installed over the top of the ceiling joists providing complete coverage. Blanket insulation is supplied as rolls for easy and fast installation. The best option is a double-layer of insulation. The first layer is installed between joists and a blanket layer is installed over the top. If installed correctly, this will eliminate heat loss and ensure your home stays warm in winter and cool in summer.",

For H1 purposes, New Zealand has six climate zones that reflect their different temperatures. There are several different types of ceiling insulation. Segments or Pads are the conventional format for insulation products. These are simply installed snug between ceiling joists. Because they don\u2019t cover the ceiling joists you lose heat through \u2018thermal bridging\u2019. Insulation blankets can help avoid thermal bridging as they are installed over the top of the ceiling joists, providing complete coverage. Blanket insulation is supplied as rolls for easy and fast installation. The best option is a double-layer of insulation. The first layer is installed between the ceiling joists with a second layer blanket installed over the top.

    "content": "SNOITSEUQ DEKSA YLTNEUQERF greenstuf.co.nz FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS WHY IS GREENSTUF MORE EXPENSIVE THAN FIBREGLASS? Put simply, you get what you pay for. The raw material, chemicals, and processes used to manufacture fibreglass are reflected in the price. However, that cheaper material comes at a big cost to performance, health, and the environment. Unlike most fibreglass insulation, GreenStuf will not deteriorate, slump, or break down over time. ARE THERE ANY ADDED CHEMICALS USED IN THE GREENSTUF MANUFACTURING PROCESS? No, we use heat to bind the fibres that form the structure of GreenStuf. Some manufacturers of fibreglass insulation still use formaldehyde based binders. Formaldehyde is a known and classified human carcinogen. WHAT IS POLYESTER? Polyester is a synthetic fibre made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\u2014the same material used to make plastic drink bottles. GreenStuf contains as much as 92% recycled polyester fibre from previously used PET drink bottles, keeping them out of landfills. WHAT DOES \u2018R-VALUE\u2019 MEAN? The R-Value of insulation is the industry standard measurement of thermal resistance. The higher the R-Value the greater the performance. CAN I INSTALL INSULATION MYSELF? Yes, installing GreenStuf is easy. Installation instructions are included with all of our products. Easy to follow ceiling and underfloor installation videos are also available online.",

An STC rating is the industry recognised assessment of the acoustic performance of a construction system. The higher the STC number, the better the acoustic performance. \u25a0 Identify rooms that need extra sound insulation to keep noise out (i.e. bedrooms, and office/study). \u25a0 Identify rooms that need extra sound insulation to keep noise in (i.e. home theatre rooms, ensuite and bathrooms, laundry and internal garages). \u25a0 Try to separate living areas from sleeping areas. Use hallways to help isolate home theatre rooms from living and sleeping areas. \u25a0 Make sure all joints in walls and ceilings are as airtight as possible Plasterboard joints in walls and ceilings should be sealed with acoustic sealant when the plasterboard is being installed. Make sure powerpoints are not set back-to-back between rooms, and thatrecessed downlights are minimised downstairs.",

    "content": "greenstuf.co.nz A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has signalled an intention to shift towards buildings with improved energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. As a result, the Building for Climate Change (BfCC) programme has been set up to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building and construction sector, which is a significant contributor. Embodied carbon and operational costs are two areas of initial focus. The BfCC will evaluate eight clauses in the Building Code over the next five years, beginning with H1 Energy Efficiency. The changes for housing and small buildings (<300m2) have been made to reduce 40% of the energy required for heating and cooling. Large buildings (<300m2) aim to reduce by 23%. To make buildings warmer, drier, healthier, and more energy-efficient, MBIE considered increasing the minimum insulation levels for roofs, windows, walls and floors for new housing and small buildings. As a result, MBIE announced changes to clause H1 Energy Efficiency which took effect on the 29th November 2021 with a transition period of one year ending 3rd November 2022. The following document explains the background of the changes and MBIE\u2019s vision for the future. It also provides guidelines on meeting the new requirements with GreenStuf Insulation. The solutions are based on systems supported by calculation and modelling methods for compliance verification, which look at overall building performance.",

    "content": "SNOITSEUQ DEKSA YLTNEUQERF greenstuf.co.nz FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS WHY IS GREENSTUF\u00ae MORE EXPENSIVE THAN FIBREGLASS? Put simply, you get what you pay for. The raw material, chemicals, and processes used to manufacture fibreglass are reflected in the price. However, that cheaper material comes at a big cost to performance, health, and the environment. Unlike most fibreglass insulation, GreenStuf will not deteriorate, slump, or break down over time. ARE THERE ANY ADDED CHEMICALS USED IN THE GREENSTUF MANUFACTURING PROCESS? No, we use heat to bind the fibres that form the structure of GreenStuf. Some manufacturers of fibreglass insulation still use formaldehyde based binders. Formaldehyde is a known and classified human carcinogen. WHAT IS POLYESTER? Polyester is a synthetic fibre made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\u2014the same material used to make plastic drink bottles. GreenStuf contains as much as 92% of recycled polyester fibre from previously used PET drink bottles, keeping them out of landfills. WHAT DOES \u2018R-VALUE\u2019 MEAN? The R-Value of insulation is the industry standard measurement of thermal resistance. The higher the R-Value the greater the performance. CAN I INSTALL INSULATION MYSELF? Yes, installing GreenStuf is easy. Installation instructions are included with all of our products. Easy to follow ceiling and underfloor installation videos are also available online.",
