We consider this an investment in present and future generations, and climate change simply a cost of doing business. We calculate the embodied carbon of our products, from the raw material to the manufacturing gate, using industry recognised ISO standards. We have reduced the carbon footprint of our products through smart design and efficient manufacturing. While the embodied carbon of our products is low, they still do have a carbon impact. We mitigate this through our Carbon Neutral Product Initiative by offsetting the equivalent emissions using certified carbon credits. These carbon credits are generated from projects focused on renewable energy, fuel The climate crisis is the biggest issue of our generation. As a product designer and manufacturer, switching, and reforestation around the world. we have an opportunity to help improve the carbon impact of our industry.

Light vacuuming on a regular basis will prevent dust build up, and most marks can be cleaned with a mild detergent solution followed by rinsing and blotting. Stains should be dealt with according to the chart below. Before carrying out a proposed cleaning method, patch test on a concealed section to ensure it will not affect the adhesive or product. Avoid severe abrasion. Spot clean only. Vacuum to restore pile, but do not use a stiff brush. Autex Acoustic products are designed with good health and hygiene in mind and can be disinfected to prevent germs and pathogens. Autex Acoustics recommends disinfecting product surfaces using isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) or ethanol diluted to 70 percent with water. Disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium compounds may also be effective. NB: Frontier\u2122, Cascade\u2122, Lattice, and Horizon\u2122 will need to be removed from the ceiling or wall to clean safely. Disassembly instructions can be found in individual product Install Instructions. We do not recommend using solvent-based solutions on Autex Acoustic products.

Interior acoustics features must be designed so that condensation risks are mitigated, moulds do not grow on the surface, and any metal components do not corrode and fail over time. An acoustic feature covered in mould and mildew is both unhealthy and unsightly. Likewise, any acoustic ceiling with corroded fixings may result in the collapse of the ceiling which is a safety risk for occupants of the space. This highlights the importance of correct design of acoustic wall and ceiling systems in humid environments. Moulds and mildew are microscopic fungi that exist everywhere. These microbes can grow and multiply under a combination of four conditions: 1. Indoor temperature \u2013 Temperatures must be between 15 - 35\u00b0C for moulds to thrive. The ideal indoor temperature for people to feel thermal comfort is also within this range. 2. Water \u2013 Moulds thrive in damp, humid conditions, typically between 70 - 95% relative humidity. 3. Nutrients \u2013 Moulds need a food source to grow. Moulds feed on any organic matter, including wood, paper, and dust that contains organic matter. 4. Oxygen \u2013 Moulds need oxygen to survive, which is present in all habitable indoor environments. Moulds and mildew can grow on any material surface, including glass, metal, and plasterboard or drywall, if all the above conditions are met.",

High humidity environments are common in locations closer to the equator or to a body of water. For example, many coastal cities in southern states that border the Gulf of Mexico are considered the most humid cities in the US. Similarly, coastal areas of New Zealand and the UK have high annual average relative humidity levels ranging from 70 to 90%. Major centres along the Australian coastline, including Darwin, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney, may experience high relative humidity levels of up to 80%. Condensation As relative humidity levels go closer to 100%, there is a higher probability of condensation occurring. Condensation occurs in indoor spaces when the indoor air is so saturated with moisture that it can no longer hold more moisture. Condensation can also occur when warm humid air comes into contact with cold surfaces. Effects of High humidity in an indoor space can have detrimental effects to the materials in that high humidity space as well as the occupants.

Our products have been independently tested and results show that when left in a 49\u00b0C and 95% relative humidity environment for four days, the product only absorbed 0.4% water. This is extremely good performance and is unique to the material used to make our product. Autex Acoustics products have also been tested for mould resistance and no mould growth was observed on the tested product when exposed to mould spores at 30\u00b0C and 90% relative humidity for 28 days. Although Autex Acoustics products do not inherently promote the growth of moulds and mildew, moulds and mildew might grow on the surface when the previously mentioned four listed conditions are present. Moulds can grow particularly when nutrients are introduced to the product surface, such as when organic matter is blown from an air conditioning vent on to the surface, or when organic matter is carried with condensation from a source to the product. Water needed for mould growth may come from condensation somewhere which then travels to the product. An example of this would be when condensation occurs on the underside of a roof and the resulting water droplets fall on top of a suspended ceiling. Preventing condensation By preventing condensation, the risk of mould growth is reduced significantly.",

Preventing condensation By preventing condensation, the risk of mould growth is reduced significantly. Adequate ventilation combined with best practice wall and ceiling design is critical to preventing condensation. To avoid condensation while keeping occupants comfortable, The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air- Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends: \u2022 Indoor temperatures to be between 19 - 28\u00b0C, and \u2022 Relative humidity to be below 65%. The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), another reputed international authority in building services and ventilation, recommends a similar target for relative humidity of 40 - 70%. Indoor swimming pools pose higher risks of condensation due to the presence of significant amounts of water, and as such has more stringent requirements. According to ASHRAE, indoor air temperature must be maintained 1 - 2\u00b0C above the pool temperature but not more than 30\u00b0C, and relative humidity must be maintained between 50% - 60%. To achieve these ideal conditions, adequately designed heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and controls must be employed. There must be good HVAC operational management in place before interior acoustics products are installed in a space.

This same advice also applies to other materials in the same environment. Autex Acoustics products installed on ceilings must not create an airtight cavity in the roof to prevent a significant temperature difference across the cavity. This would reduce the risk of condensation caused by warmer air encountering a cold surface. There should also be efficient air distribution in the roof area to direct humid air away from the roof, further reducing the risk of condensation. When installing acoustic panels on ceilings, it is important that any cavity between the roof and the acoustic panel is kept well-ventilated to avoid condensation.",

Vertical acoustic baffle products such as Frontier\u2122 are recommended as they pose a lower risk of condensation by allowing efficient air movement through the ceiling and not causing any significant temperature difference in the roof that may result to condensation. Clients are advised to consult with their Autex Acoustics account manager during the design phase of a project involving humid spaces. Autex Acoustics have been involved with installations in high humidity environments for many years and in that time have gathered specific knowledge in addressing issues of condensation and mould growth. Our design team can create bespoke products that are unique to the conditions and requirements of each project. c.

We consider this an investment in present and future generations, and climate change simply a cost of doing business. We calculate the embodied carbon of our products, from the raw material to the manufacturing gate, using industry recognised ISO standards. We have reduced the carbon footprint of our products through smart design and effi cient manufacturing. While the embodied carbon of our products is low, they still do have a carbon impact. We mitigate this through our Carbon Neutral Product Initiative by offsetting the equivalent emissions using certifi ed carbon credits. These carbon credits are generated from projects focused on renewable energy, fuel The climate crisis is the biggest issue of our generation. As a product designer and manufacturer, switching, and reforestation around the world. we have an opportunity to help improve the carbon impact of our industry.

Static screens are 1200 mm by 2400 mm, holding space without obstructing sightline in open-plan environments. Folding screens are the same dimensions, but their water-cut patterns fold out, increasing surface area for acoustic absorption. Expanding Screens start at 1200 mm by 2400 mm, growing 100% in size through a series of intricate cuts to form fine, lace-esque patterns. Lightweight yet sturdy, Cascade Hanging Screens are semi-permanent by nature; easy to install, uninstall, and move around your space as required.

Some paints contain additives that could make a permanent bond difficult to achieve. When you suspect the paint or coating may contain these additives, sanding the wall with a fine sand paper or steel-wool can help improve adhesion. Ensure the surface is washed down to remove any residual dust from this process. All surfaces should be washed with a detergent that will not leave a residue, and should be allowed to dry fully. For more advice on specific applications, please contact your local distributor. We recommend that one tile be installed first to ascertain the suitability of the surface and preparation.",

    "content": "Wool Care and Fabric Maintenance Guide Autex Acoustics\u00ae products are durable and require little attention to maintain their good looks. Light vacuuming on a regular basis will prevent dust build up, and most marks can be cleaned with a mild detergent solution followed by rinsing and blotting. Stains should be dealt with according to the chart below. Before carrying out a proposed cleaning method, patch test on a concealed section to ensure it will not affect the product. Avoid rubbing and abrasion and do not scrub or use a stiff brush. Spot clean only. Autex Acoustics products are designed with good health and hygiene in mind and can be disinfected to prevent germs and pathogens using hydrogen peroxide or isopropyl alcohol. Always scoop or blot any excess spills quickly using white tissue or an absorbent towel. Remove solids with a blunt knife or spoon. DO NOT apply a stain repellent treatment that contains silicone or chlorine bleach, as this can accelerate soiling and discolour the product. We recommend using a spot cleaner/wet vacuum with most stain types. Ensure any scrubbing brushes on the head of the vacuum are removed, and the detergent solution is colour safe. A spot cleaner will lift stains out of the wool and will help when used in conjunction with the cleaning guide below.",

With clean lines and simple, two-dimensional geometric forms, Horizon elegantly holds space as both a design feature and a high-performance acoustic absorber. Made from 100% polyester fibre, Horizon panels are lightweight yet strong; easily installed on ceilings and walls without the need for clear space, as the channels, clips, and suspension wires require limited contact. The adjustable suspension system allows you to set the hanging height with ease, giving you the ability to target multiple frequency levels within the space. Horizon can also be clipped to walls as a removable acoustic panel, without the need for adhesives.

We wholeheartedly believe that we are responsible for ensuring our products are as sustainable as possible throughout their lifecycle and that we are stewards of them. Our key sustainability pillar, Closing the Loop, is underpinned by the view that unused materials are resources, not waste, and this steers our direction towards product circularity. ReForm forms part of this journey and is a leap forward for interior acoustic products. Polyester acoustic products typically use fibre that is made from recycled bottle flakes. ReForm allows us to create a circular product by reclaiming any polyester panel or insulation back into the next generation of product and extending the useful life of the material. The benefit of this is that it maintains the same quality and value of the material, it\u2019s local, and requires less energy and carbon than other recycling options.

Vicinity Workstation Screens explore this opportunity by recycling in-house waste through a new process we pioneered called RePET. This allows us to create products that have a completely circular lifecycle. Through the RePET process, we have been able to remanufacture over 160,000 kgs* of waste into raw materials that can be made into new components like our Vicinity Workstation Clamps. *Data calculated as of December 2024 and subject to future updates.
