    "content": "Acoustic Bafflestack Mammoth Bafflestack helps to create comfortable internal environments by improving sound insulation between spaces. Mammoth\u00ae Bafflestack insulation is a roll form product made from 100% thermally bonded polyester fibres, designed to be stacked and compressed within the plenum space above partition walls, to the roof or floor above. This reduces sound intensity and transference between rooms, without the need for the construction of walls within the plenum space. Mammoth products contain recycled polyester fibres. Mammoth acoustic bafflestack insulation uses up to 3,700 recycled plastic bottles per 100sqm*. Mammoth's acoustic range also includes Wall Sections, Wall Blankets, Panel Absorber and Duct Liner Insulation.

    "content": "Acoustic Panel Absorber Mammoth\u00ae Panel Absorber is designed to be used as an interior surface lining in commercial or residential spaces to help reduce noise reverberation. Mammoth\u00ae Panel Absorber acoustic insulation is a 100% polyester semi rigid board in white, white with black face, black or grey. With a Group 1S fire rating under the ISO 9705 Fire test, it is suitable for use in exit ways and a variety of occupied spaces and HVAC systems. Mammoth Panel Absorber is available in various densities and thicknesses, ranging from 35-25mm, 35-50mm, 35-75mm, 20-100mm and 40-100mm and are 2400mm x 1200mm panel sizes. Custom cuts are available for larger projects with MOQ. Mammoth Panel Absorber is manufactured using two different processes, airlay and card. While the functions and specifications of Mammoth Panel Absorber produced in both ways remain the same, the appearance is different, which is most apparent on the grey panels. Airlay manufacturing produces a distinctly mottled grey finish, while the card is a more uniform grey with some tonal variations. Panel Absorber is suitable for use in most exposed applications, but is primarily designed for acoustic performance rather than a high visual finish as it may show some creasing, finish and colour variations. Please contact your local Mammoth representative for more information and samples.",

An effective and easy form of thermal insulation, Mammoth\u00ae Modern Insulation ceiling blankets have a range of R-values of up to R4.0, or R8.0 when double layered. Mammoth blankets are long lasting, won't sag or settle over time, are non-irritant and highly effective. Mammoth products contain recycled polyester fibres. Mammoth ceiling blanket insulation uses up to 7,400 recycled PET plastic bottles per 100sqm*. For new ceilings without a roof space there is the option of our Mammoth Skillion Ceiling Sections and for skillion and truss roofs we have Mammoth Ceiling Battens. Can be double layered to meet the new Building Code. Mammoth ceiling blankets are manufactured in roll form so that they can be installed as both a single or double layer system. For any system - single or double layered - the joist depth must be greater than the insulation thickness. Mammoth ceiling blankets are designed in widths to fit snugly between joists or trusses in a single layer option or alternatively with a second layer run perpendicular to the first, covering the top of the joists or truss bottom chord reducing thermal bridging in these areas.",

    "content": "Duct Insulation Liner Mammoth Duct Liner is designed to absorb noise and thermally insulate HVAC ducts. The polyester liner ensures the reduction of sound transfer along the duct and that air of the desired temperature is delivered at the outlets. Mammoth\u00ae Duct Liner comes in a plain white sheet or a white sheet with a black face. Mammoth Duct Liner is a semi rigid board made in New Zealand from 100% thermally bonded polyester fibres. The polyester conjugate fibre used is crimped giving excellent durability. Mammoth's acoustic range also includes Wall Sections, Wall Blankets, Bafflestack and Panel Absorber insulation.

KEY FEATURES Mammoth Duct Liner (previously NOVAhush) is supplied plain and can have perforated foil or plain foil applied. Independent testing shows that Mammoth Duct Liner gives exceptional performance at the low end frequencies (125 - 500 Hertz). Absorbs fan drumming noise and reduces speech transference from room to room between air conditioning outlets. The thermal qualities eliminates the need to insulate the exterior of the ducting. Mammoth Duct Liner will not shed particles (fibre fall-out) or delaminate under high air flow velocities - ensuring the airstream remains clean. Assists in absorbing noise to create a quieter environment. The product is not conducive to fungal bacteria growth. Unaffected by moisture, Mammoth insulation will continue to perform once dried out. Mammoth is moisture, mould and mildew resistant. When installed to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions it will remain in place ensuring the thermal effectiveness of the installed system. Safe, non-itch, odourless and non-toxic - no precautions are required for handling the product. Lightweight and easy to handle - can easily be cut using wide blade craft knives or specialised insulation saws. Heat bonded - no glues or binders that can break down so it won't sag or settle over time. Red List Free - no formaldehyde or pesticides added. NZ Green Building Council approved.",

Unless specifically required, Mammoth Duct Liner should be fixed in close contact with the duct surfaces. Edges should overlap and be sealed to prevent air gaps. Depending on duct size, Mammoth Duct Liner may require fixing using mechanical or adhesive methods. Where a vapour barrier is required, Mammoth Duct Liner should be completely sealed with 75mm aluminum tape or a suitable contact adhesive on all joints, and on penetrations such as mechanical fixings or control equipment. Installation methods outside these guidelines must be approved by the specifying engineer.

    "content": "Installation Guide Surface Preparation dECO products can be installed on substrates including plasterboard, concrete and fibre cement. Substrates with textured or rough surfaces are not recommended. Before installation, ensure all joins and gaps in the substrate are sealed. Sealing tape should be used on the substrate as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to tape joins on walls in order to prevent dust or foreign matter from migrating from the wall cavity. Ensure the surface is clean and free of dust or imperfections that could prevent adhesion. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Allow to dry prior to proceeding. Measuring Measure the wall or ceiling area before installation and refer to the installation plan for placement. Verify the length of each wall section as walls are not always perfectly straight. Place a level to check the wall. If not level, you may need to make good the wall. Transfer measurement markings to the back side of the dECO product. Cutting Trial cut on a scrap piece prior to cutting to ensure the highest possible finish. Saws will behave differently on sheets of different thickness and density. Roll Products Use a sharp utility knife and a metal guide. Sheet Products Use a plunge cut circular saw or bandsaw with a wave toothing (not serrated) blade and a metal guide. Do not use a blade with side-set teeth. Always use sharp and clean blades. Do not remove safety guards from cutting equipment and wear the necessary safety equipment.",

Do not remove safety guards from cutting equipment and wear the necessary safety equipment. As dECO products are made from 100% polyester, use a slow, consistent feed rate to prevent overheating when cutting. The frictional heat can melt or fuse slightly the heated contact points with saw blade. Feed against the rotation of the blade or tool. Hold sheet firmly while cutting to minimise vibration. Use just enough clamp pressure to prevent vibration. Note: if sheets are to be butt joined together, sheets can be precision cut to square edges for an extra charge. Please contact your CSR Martini representative for further details. Fixing and Contact Adhesives dECO products can be direct fixed with contact adhesive. It\u2019s the installer\u2019s responsibility to ensure the adhesive used is fit for purpose. Adhesives should be used as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Trial the adhesive to check the bond is satisfactory. CSR Martini takes no responsibility for any issues relating to adhesion.

COMPANY DETAILS Name InZone Industries Ltd t/a Mammoth\u00ae Modern Insulation Role Manufacturer NZBN 9429032370263 Address 27 Birmingham Rd, Otara, Auckland 2013 Website www.mammoth.co.nz Email info@mammoth.co.nz Phone 0800 626 668 DESCRIPTION OF BUILDING PRODUCT The Mammoth Acoustic Panel Absorber is manufactured in NZ from thermally bonded polyester fibres which are extracted from recycled plastic bottles. The panel is intended for use as a fully finished exposed building element that reduces noise reverberation as given by a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC). The panels may also contribute to acoustic performance when incorporated in an internal or external wall, or mid- floor specification, and the acoustic performance is calculated using the Mammoth acoustic performance software or specifically designed by an acoustic engineer. All panels provide some thermal efficiency performance. Some of the panels have been tested to NZS 4859.1 and Mammoth has stated an R-value. Depending on the manufacturing process, the appearance of the panel can be mottled or uniform. Polyester insulation products are resistant to moisture.",

The insulation is supplied in blanket form or in semi-rigid sections. Semi-rigid sections are particularly suitable for use in, \u2022 roofs where there is minimal gap, such as skillion roofs, \u2022 where friction fit installation is preferred, and \u2022 underfloor. Mammoth insulation is manufactured from recycled plastic bottles. Blanket insulation uses a minimum of 7400 bottles/100 m2 insulation whereas semi-rigid sections require more polyester fibre and so up to a minimum of 9000/100 m2 insulation is used. The insulation is manufactured via one of two processes; carded (blanket), or airlay (semi-rigid). Polyester insulation is resistant to moisture.
