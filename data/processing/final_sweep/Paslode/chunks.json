Table 2: Collated nails label descriptions Nail Material Label Colour Bright steel White Mechanically galvanised steel Tan Hot-dip galvanised steel, with and without black coating Yellow Stainless steel Red 4.3 Collated Paslode Nails for use with Paslode nail guns are generally collated together with paper strips down both sides of the nails, however some of the nails are collated together with plastic. 4.4 Only Paslode nailing tools, as supplied by Paslode New Zealand, are to be used to install Paslode collated nails. The Paslode nail guns have not been assessed by BRANZ and are outside the scope of this Appraisal. Handling and Storage 5.1 Paslode Nails should be stored in a clean, dry area until they are used. Technical Literature 6.1 No specific Technical Literature is referenced by this Appraisal. Design Information Structure 7.1 Connections incorporating Paslode Nails must be designed and installed in accordance with the relevant non-specific design standards, e.g. NZS 3604, or as specified by specific engineering design to the relevant loading and design standards. 7.2 Where a proprietary system manufacturer specifies standard nails, permission must be obtained from them before Paslode Nails are substituted.",

Durability 8.1 Paslode Nails are expected to have a serviceable life of at least 15 or 50 years (depending on their use) provided that they are installed and maintained in accordance with this Appraisal. 8.2 Table 3 gives information on where each of the types of Paslode Nails identified in Table 1 may be used, based on the timber use, the environment, the timber moisture content and the timber treatment. Table 3 is for Corrosion Zone B, as defined by NZS 3604. Table 4 gives the same information for Corrosion Zones C and D, as defined by NZS 3604. 8.3 If ACQ-based or CuAz-based treatments are used for timber Hazard Classes H3.2, H4 or H5, then only stainless steel fasteners should be used in exposed or sheltered locations in accordance with NZS 3604, Clause 4.4.4. There is very little of these timber treatments in use in New Zealand at this time, and most timber is treated with CCA. Maintenance 9.1 Paslode Nails need little or no maintenance in themselves. Where paint or coatings are required to ensure the required design life, then these must be maintained as per the relevant manufacturer\u2019s instructions.
