    "content": "GENERAL PRYDA BUILDING GUIDE OVERVIEW Pryda has developed this guide to accommodate New Zealand building practices. It is important that designers, engineers, builders, inspectors and building authorities are familiar with the benefits and critical requirements of the system. Pryda timber connectors, trusses and beams comply with the New Zealand Building Code, Section B1 Structure and B2 Durability, having been designed in accordance with sound and widely accepted engineering principles to comply with NZS3604:2011. The capacities reported in this publication are limit state design capacities and not characteristic strengths thereby allowing direct comparison with design reactions reported in Pryda design software and Pryda design reports. This document supersedes and replaces all the previous publications of Builder's Guide. For further design advice or engineering support regarding the Pryda products discussed in this publication please phone us at 0800 88 22 44 or visit our website - www.pryda.co.nz. The Pryda Design Guide features a Building Consent Documentation Reference for many connection details. This is aimed to encourage designers to align details in the building consent documentation with useful information for easy reference for builders and building officials at the time of inspection. The process is illustrated on the following page. It should be recognised that this is not a requirement, and fabricators may choose to present information in various formats.",

    "content": "GENERAL When producing an 'As Built' truss layout and final truss detailing for supply, it is expected that a fabricator shall give consideration to any 'Buildable' truss layout that has been consented by a BCA. The fabricator shall consider any structural implications that may result from a different layout to that consented and if any changes are to be made then these shall be communicated to the customer to pass on to their design team for consideration and approval before proceeding with supply. It is not expected that fabricators should have to follow exactly a consented layout, particularly when a competitive party may have provided it. However, a fabricator will have to produce an 'As Built' truss layout as per 2.3.1. This two stage process is reflected in section 7.5 of the guidance document \"Guide to applying for a building consent\" published by the Department of Building and Housing. Acknowledgement and support for the COP Section 2 \u2013 Truss Documentation is also outlined in the publication from DBH Codewords issue 044. Both publications are available online at www.dbh.govt.nz. While it is expected that the documentation is going to be provided to assist a BCA in the consent or CCC process it should be noted that the contractual relationship is between a fabricator and its customer and that the responsibility to provide this information to a BCA rests with the applicant for a building consent.

For machine driven nails, refer to section \u201cFastening Cyclone Straps\u201d Pryda CODEMARK certificate CMNZ10029 certifies Pryda Cyclone Straps with use of NZ Pryda Timber Connector Nails. Other fixing methods are outside the scope of the CODEMARK. 2.When the strap is wrapped around the wall plate or other timber member and fixed with 4 nails per leg driven into the underside of the top plate, the capacity is limited by the steel. Tests have proven that bending the legs of Cyclone Straps around the timber increases the ultimate load the strap can carry. 3.Limit State Design capacities are shown in table to resist Wind Uplift. 4.Design values are based on SG8 timber and meets minimum JD5 timber as defined in AS/NZS 1720.

Note this is not as strong a connection as wrapping under the top plate and the number of nails into the face of the beam will dictate the capacity as shown in the design capacity table. 2 nails to each face of truss. 2 to 6 nails on beam/lintel per leg. See table for capacities for each nail group. FASTENING CYCLONE STRAPS BUILD WITH CONFIDENCE Where possible, hand nailing with Pryda Timber Connector nails is always preferred, why? \u2022 Pryda Timber Connector Nails are forged in one piece, unlike clouts that are two pieces soldered together, meaning the head can pop off. \u2022 Pryda Nails are the correct diameter, ensuring a tight fit in prepunched holes = a stronger connection. \u2022 Design values and testing have all been conducted using Pryda Timber Connector Nails. \u2022 Hand hammered nails ensure correct nail positioning and drive depth (not driven too shallow or too deep).

Standard Multigrips or Triple Grips do not have the required length to cover both the top plate and ribbon plate. \u2022 If the Ribbon plate is not adequately fixed to the lower top plate, it will not be able to contribute to resisting uplift. \u2022 Nail lamination of the ribbon plate to the lower top plate is typically insufficient to resist these loads. \u2022 In this example, if the ribbon plate is not sufficiently tied down to the lower top plate it can de-laminate resulting in the trusses lifting off the building. \u2022 This example illustrates how the longer leg (MPMGL), can engage both top plates.

    "content": "GENERAL PRYDA BUILDING GUIDE OVERVIEW Pryda has developed this guide to accommodate New Zealand building practices. It is important that designers, engineers, builders, inspectors and building authorities are familiar with the benefits and critical requirements of the system. Pryda timber connectors, trusses and beams comply with the New Zealand Building Code, Section B1 Structure and B2 Durability, having been designed in accordance with sound and widely accepted engineering principles to comply with NZS3604:2011. The capacities reported in this publication are limit state design capacities and not characteristic strengths thereby allowing direct comparison with design reactions reported in Pryda design software and Pryda design reports. This document supersedes and replaces all the previous publications of Builder's Guide. For further design advice or engineering support regarding the Pryda products discussed in this publication please phone us at 0800 88 22 44 or visit our website - www.pryda.co.nz. The Pryda Design Guide features a Building Consent Documentation Reference for many connection details. This is aimed to encourage designers to align details in the building consent documentation with useful information for easy reference for builders and building officials at the time of inspection. The process is illustrated on the following page. It should be recognised that this is not a requirement, and fabricators may choose to present information in various formats.",

Install the concealed purlin cleat to the structural framing.\n     2. Attach the cyclone strap to the required points, ensuring the wrap legs fit under the support.\n\n4. **Critical Details:**\n   - Ensure proper **overlaps** of the cyclone strap for effective load distribution.\n   - Maintain **gaps** as required to prevent moisture entrapment.\n   - Observe **minimum clearances** between components to comply with building standards, particularly for structural integrity during wind events.\n\nThis description uses terminology consistent with NZ/AU construction practices and addresses the relevant\n\nPage context: GENERAL NC8 1 / NPPC8 Concealed Purlin Cleat Q6 1 / MPQHS6 Cyclone Strap Roof Component Q9 1 / QHS9 Cyclone Strap Tie Down 1 / MPQHS6 Cyclone Strap, wrap legs under support Connection Q6* member Q9* 1",

    "content": "GENERAL When producing an 'As Built' truss layout and final truss detailing for supply, it is expected that a fabricator shall give consideration to any 'Buildable' truss layout that has been consented by a BCA. The fabricator shall consider any structural implications that may result from a different layout to that consented and if any changes are to be made then these shall be communicated to the customer to pass on to their design team for consideration and approval before proceeding with supply. It is not expected that fabricators should have to follow exactly a consented layout, particularly when a competitive party may have provided it. However, a fabricator will have to produce an 'As Built' truss layout as per 2.3.1. This two stage process is reflected in section 7.5 of the guidance document \"Guide to applying for a building consent\" published by the Department of Building and Housing. Acknowledgement and support for the COP Section 2 \u2013 Truss Documentation is also outlined in the publication from DBH Codewords issue 044. Both publications are available online at www.dbh.govt.nz. While it is expected that the documentation is going to be provided to assist a BCA in the consent or CCC process it should be noted that the contractual relationship is between a fabricator and its customer and that the responsibility to provide this information to a BCA rests with the applicant for a building consent.

Ensure PBA fits within the wall frame plane. 2.Present PBA to junction of bottom plate and stud ensuring a snug fit to both surfaces referring to relevant floor installation detail shown in application details to ensure correct placement across face of bottom plate. 3.Mark position of bolt or M12 screw using the PBA as a guide and remove PBA. Ensure the selected anchorage into the supporting member has an equivalent or better capacity to PBA. When connecting to a solid beam, ensure the M12 bolt or screw is central to the beam. For concrete slab connection near edge, minimum concrete edge distance shall be maintained. 4.Drill appropriate size hole for bolt or screw with reference to supplier\u2019s data sheet for correct hole size and use of the fastening. 5.Place the PBA into position and fasten home the screw or bolt to a snug fit, ensuring face of PBA is tight against face of stud. 6.Screw 5 x Pryda 12G x 35mm Pryda Timber Connector screws into the stud flange. 7.Re-check the tightness of the M12 screw or anchor bolt. 8.Finally screw 2 x Pryda 12G x 35mm Timber Connector screws into the bottom plate flange.

    "content": "Pryda Building Guide Pryda has developed this guide to accommodate New Zealand building practices. It is important that designers, engineers, builders, inspectors and building authorities are familiar with the benefits and critical requirements of the system. Pryda timber connectors, trusses and beams comply with the New Zealand Building Code, Section B1 Structure and B2 Durability, having been designed in accordance with sound and widely accepted engineering principles to comply with NZS3604:2011. The capacities reported in this publication are limited state design capacities and not characteristics strength thereby allowing direct comparison with design reactions reported in Pryda design software and Pryda design reports. For engineers requiring characteristic strength please refer to the Pryda Product Catalogue which is available in hard copy or downloadable from our website \u2013 www.pryda.co.nz. For further design advice or engineering support regarding the Pryda products discussed in the publication please phone us at 0800 88 22 44 or visit our website - www.pryda.co.nz. The Pryda Builders Guide features a Building Consent Documentation Reference for many connection details. This is aimed to encourage designers to align details in the building consent documentation with useful information in the Pryda Builders Guide for easy reference for builders and building officials at the time of inspection. The process is illustrated on the following page.",

In this way there is a basis for comparison with non- members as well as an industry based benchmark from which expectations can be managed. 1.2 Intention It is intended that: \u2022 Adherence to the Code of Practice will enable a qualifying fabricator to certify and mark their product as compliant to the Code of Practice; \u2022 After a period of implementation and review adherence to the Code of Practice will be audited by a third party auditor; \u2022 That adherence to the Code of Practice will be required for membership of FTMA. 1.3 Content The Code of Practice includes: \u2022 Section 2 - Truss Documentation 2 Truss documentation 2.1 Introduction The intention of this section is to describe the documentation required to be produced by a fabricator of nail-plated timber trusses for use by its customer. The information contained in the document may be used by a Building Consent Authority (BCA) to satisfy the provisions of the Building Act 2004 and reasonable BCA processes in the issuing of a Building Consent or Code Compliance Certificate (CCC).

For practical purposes the production of the documentation is a two stage process. The first stage is to provide documentation to support the issuing of a building consent. This can be achieved by providing: \u2022 a 'Buildable' truss layout; \u2022 a Fabricator Design Statement and; \u2022 a Producer Statement \u2013 Design. These documents show that trusses have been designed by an accredited fabricator1, licensed to use specific design software, applying the appropriate loads and using the appropriate materials to ensure compliance with the NZ Building Code (NZBC) as well as giving notification of any resultant loads that may affect the supporting structure. This documentation is intended to be provided to the \u201cdesign lead\u201d2 to then consider when completing the structural design before providing it to the BCA as part of a building consent application. The BCA may then issue a building consent that is subject to receiving further documentation. 8 General",

This can be achieved by providing: \u2022 an 'As Built' truss layout; \u2022 a Fabricator Design Statement; \u2022 a Producer Statement \u2013 Design and; \u2022 a Manufacturing Statement. This is similar documentation to that provided for the first stage but ensures that the final construction details of the manufactured trusses accurately reflect what was built, which can then be recorded by the BCA as part of the project documentation. Such further documentation then satisfies the conditions on which the consent had been issued. The documentation is intended to be provided to the builder on-site and to the customer who should make it available to the BCA prior to on-site inspection. When producing an 'As Built' truss layout and final truss detailing for supply, it is expected that a fabricator shall give consideration to any 'Buildable' truss layout that has been consented by a BCA. The fabricator shall consider any structural implications that may result from a different layout to that consented and if any changes are to be made then these shall be communicated to the customer to pass on to their design team for consideration and approval before proceeding with supply. It is not expected that fabricators should have to follow exactly a consented layout, particularly when it may have been provided by a competitive party.",

This two stage process is reflected in section 7.5 of the guidance document \"Guide to applying for a building consent\" published by the Department of Building and Housing. Acknowledgement and support for the COP Section 2 \u2013 Truss Documentation is also outlined in the publication from DBH Codewords issue 044. Both publications are available online at www.dbh.govt.nz While it is expected that the documentation is going to be provided to assist a BCA in the consent or CCC process it should be noted that the contractual relationship is between a fabricator and its customer and that the responsibility to provide this information to a BCA rests with the applicant for a building consent. 1 An accredited fabricator is a company that has a formal agreement with a nail-plate manufacturer to use their products in the manufacture of trusses. The nail-plate manufacturer in turn licenses the fabricator to use specific design software supplied and underwritten by the nail-plate manufacturer. 2 A design lead refers to the architect or draftsperson responsible for the overall design of the building 9 General",

The timber treatment hazard class H1.2 is now required for radiata pine and Douglas fir timber in buildings, where it is protected from the weather (ie, enclosed timber framing). Consult the tables in a Quick Guide to Timber Treatment for Enclosed Framing for the few exceptions to H1.2 treatment. Why H1.2? Research shows that H1.2 gives framing timber good protection from decay. H1.2 boron treatment is colour-coded pink. How can I be sure my timber framing complies with the Building Code? The changes shown here outline one way to comply with the New Zealand Building Code durability clause B2. However, this is only a very brief introduction, so consult Acceptable Solution B2/AS1 for full details. Why continue to treat timber? Timber must be adequately protected against damage from fungal and insect attack so that buildings are durable and comply with the Building Code. The new system improves the overall level of protection against decay. What about other species of wood for framing? For other species of wood and engineered wood products (such as LVL and Glulam), the Acceptable Solution does not change. For information on other species which can be used under the Acceptable Solution, consult NZS 3602:2003 Tables 1 and 2.",

    "content": "Producer Statement Pryda Structural Brackets January 2012 This Producer Statement is issued by Pryda NZ to cover the use, installation and durability of PRYDA Structural Brackets for both structural application and durability as required by the New Zealand Building Code clauses B1 & B2 respectively. Description PRYDA Structural Brackets are fabricated from flat bar steel. They are mostly available in hot dipped galvanised finish with a selection also available in stainless steel for use as an architectural feature or in certain exposed and covered situations as covered in NZS3604:2011. The zinc coating is applied in accordance with AS/NZS 4690:1999 and has a thickness of at least 1000gm/m2 which is in excess of the requirements in Table 4.2 in NZS3604:2011. Application PRYDA Structural Brackets are designed to connect timber to masonry, concrete and steel. The brackets are designed for specific connections of timber to other materials. Please contact PRYDA technical service should you require assistance for your intended application. Installation The PRYDA Structural Brackets should be installed without damage to the finished surfaces. Storage prior to use to be in dry moisture free conditions that would not affect the durability of the product. PRYDA Structural Brackets are designed for embedment into concrete, such as those with a fishtail, are required to have a 150mm minimm embedment into the footing in accordance with NZS 3604 Fig 9.2.",

    "content": ". PRYDA Structural Brackets are designed for embedment into concrete, such as those with a fishtail, are required to have a 150mm minimm embedment into the footing in accordance with NZS 3604 Fig 9.2. Characteristic Strength As with timber grades, the characteristic strength is derived by the vertification method in accordance with the NBC standard NZS3603:1993. The characteristic strength of a structural bracket is limited to the values derived from the above mentioned standards taking cognisance of bolt spacing and end distances. The mode of failure is limited to bolt in timber failure and not the steel bracket when used for its intended application. Durability The durability of the PRYDA Structural Brackets is in excess of the acceptable solutions contained in Table 4.1 of NZS3604:2011 in order to achieve a 50 year life expectancy for the brackets. Pryda Structural Brackets are hot-dipped galvanised to a level of 1000gm/m2 or higher. Independent tests show that the >3mm hot dipped galvanised steel performs as well as 304 stainless steel in corrosive situations.

    "content": "Pryda Floor and Rafter Trusses Pryda Longreach Trusses Pryda Longreach is a premium performance floor and rafter truss system using all timber webs and chords for maximum stiffness, and can be manufactured to any depth required from 235 to 450 mm. A major feature of all-timber Longreach is that low- cost increases in depth will significantly increase span capacity or stiffness. Pryda Span Trusses Pryda Span floor and rafter trusses have galvanised high strength steel diagonal webs for lightweight and economy, and are available in nominal 250, 300 and 400 mm depths. The steel web design has a patented deep V profile incorporating stiffeners for improved performance and resistance to damage during handling on site. Floor Truss Spans and Depth This table illustrates the significant increase in span capacity by increasing floor truss depth and/or higher timber grade.

    "content": "43 Walls Pryda Flitch Beams Pryda Flitch Beams comprise 2 timber beams which sandwich a 6mm, 8mm or 10mm steel plate. The 3 layers are joined together using powder actuated drive pins to make up a beam capable of longer spans than the equivalent sized timber beam. Pryda Flitch Beams are suitable for beams and lintels as they do not require the specialized packing and fixing systems associated with the use of steel beams. Pryda Flitch Beams of nominal sizes up to 300mm x 100mm and lengths up to 6m can be readily fabricated from stock timber. The span tables in the Flitch Beam: Design and load specification guide are based on steel plates 5mm less depth than the dressed timber and a minimum timber grade of SG6 or better. Pryda Flitch Beams are composite beams. It is relatively easy to introduce a camber during fabrication to overcome any problem with beam deflections. This often leads to the use of a smaller size than the required solid timber section. Pryda Flitch Beams can be adapted to suit any span or continuous beam application as the product is custom made using ex stock steel plates and standard timber sizes.",

Trusses should be stored on the job site clear of the ground and kept flat to avoid distortion. All trusses should be in- spected on delivery, and any damaged trusses reported to the fabricator immediately to ensure correct rectification. Hip End Trusses must not be modified on site without the prior written approval from the fabricator. 1.7 SAFETY The installation of timber roof trusses must adhere to the relevant safety work practices for the general construction of roofs. This will require that barriers or safety lines be installed at the appropriate time. These systems must not modify the trusses, not put loads onto the trusses, unless prior written approval is provided by the fabricator.

Lintels supporting heavy, concentrated loads will require a specific engineering design. 2.3 NON-LOAD-BEARING WALLS Non-load-bearing walls shall not carry any truss loading at any time, and shall not be packed to touch the underside of the truss. It is common to set non-load-bearing walls lower than the supporting walls by an amount equal to the depth of the ceiling battens plus 10mm.

Also refer to the Australian Standard\u00ae AS4440-2004 \u201cIn- stallation of nailplated timber trusses\u201d for greater detail. 3.2 SET OUT Prior to lifting any truss into place, it is often convenient to mark out the truss locations on the top plate, using the supplied truss layout for reference. Girder and truncated girder trusses should be set out first as they have specific, fixed locations. Dual purpose trusses such as truncated girder / girders need special at- tention as they may appear similar to other trusses which must not be used accidentally instead. Standard trusses must then be set out, taking care not to exceed the design spacing. Generally they would be evenly set out over runs of similar trusses. But it is also acceptable to space them at the design spacing and have a closing gap smaller than this - adjacent to a more heavily loaded truss, if possible. A gauging rod is very useful for setting out trusses. 3.3 LIFTING Trusses must always be lifted in a manner that minimises lateral bending stresses. It is preferable that they be kept strapped in bundles until they are erected, as this reduces the chances of damage. When positioning multiple span or cantilever trusses, take care that they are the correct way around.",

    "content": "Product substitution can be OK without formal amendments This letter is written following consultation with various councils and the Department of Building and Housing (DBH). Pryda has become aware of isolated cases in which members of the building industry have misinterpreted building code regulations and guidance on amendments or product substitution. This perception has arisen from situations in which on-site variations have quite rightly been rejected due to insufficient documentation for code compliance certificates. In other cases, councils have advised builders to substitute with caution but this has been misinterpreted as \u201cdon\u2019t substitute\u201d. The DBH has released a building controls update in Codewords 20 - May/June 2007 entitled Variations and building consent amendments. This update provides some clarity to the confusion surrounding substitution and the key messages are as follows: \u2022 I f the building consent authority has existing knowledge about a suggested alternative, justifying its compliance can be a simple matter. \u2022 S imple variations can be approved by the building official in a more informal manner (instead of formal amendments via Form 2), by making a note on the consented plans to show the building official has been consulted and given approval. Although each BCA will have a slightly different approach, Pryda expects the following scenario to transpire: \u2022 A building official conducts a pre-lining inspection for a Code Compliance Certificate.",

The Pryda organisation was founded in Napier in 1964 (originally A.R. Turner & Co), and its range of New Zealand made and engineered timber connectors continue to meet building code requirements to this day (including B1 Structure and B2 Durability). In most cases Building Officials have existing knowledge of the Pryda range and justification of compliance should be a simple matter.
