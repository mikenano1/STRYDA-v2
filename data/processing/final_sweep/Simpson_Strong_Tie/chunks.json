Practical as well, CLT can be used for walls, floors and ceilings, and is well suited to offsite assembly. CLT has various benefits, making it an attractive building material. These benefits include: Design flexibility \u2014 CLT has many applications. It can be used in walls, roofs or ceilings. The thickness of the panels can easily be increased by adding more layers, and the length of the panels can be increased by joining panels together. Prefabrication \u2014 Floors or walls made from CLT can be fully manufactured before reaching the construction site, which decreases lead times and could potentially lower overall construction costs. Engineers and architects are now favouring CLT for its elegance, sustainability and its cosmetic appearance. CLT Panel Manufacture This is a highly involved and technical process. Timber lengths are prepared and cut to suit the application and project requirements. Adhesive is applied to the timber, and it is then arranged in perpendicular layers. Hydraulic pressing is used for panels where higher pressures or specific pressure values at the panel edges are required.",

The long vertical legs on the HTT range make it possible to add the required number of fasteners, nails or screws in a post or beam to obtain the robust load capacity to suit different applications or loading requirements. The HDU is designed for use in shearwalls and braced-wall panels, as well as other uplift or tension application in timber ction. The HDU uses Strong-Drive\u00ae SDS Heavy-Duty Connector screws, which install easily, reduce fastener slip and provide a greater net section than bolts.

Design Capacity is the lesser of (1) the Characteristic Capacity multiplied by the Australian Capacity Factor, or the NZ Strength Reduction Factor (\u03a6), and applicable the k modification factors following AS 1720.1 and NZS 3603 and (2) the Serviceability Capacity, which is the load at 3.2 mm joint slip. Design Capacity is the minimum of steel and structural joint calculation. 2. For Australia, the Capacity Factor (\u03a6) is 0.80 for nails and screws for structural joints in a Category 2 application. Change tabulated values where other Category applications govern. For NZ, the Strength Reduction Factor (\u03a6) is 0.80 for nails in lateral loading and 0.70 for other fasteners. 3. Duration of Load Factor (k) is as shown for wind and earthquake loading. Reduce Duration of Load Factor (k) where applicable. Capacities may not be increased. 1 1 4. The timber species design density for joint design is 480 kg/m3. 5. If timber tends to split, consider pre-boring holes with diameters not exceeding 80% of the nail diameter (AS 1720.1 4.2.6).

Key elements include:\n   - Truss members (likely made from engineered timber)\n   - Strong-Drive SDWC truss screws for fastening\n   - Potential framing members (such as timber joists or bearers)\n\n2. **Key Measurements or Spacings**: The diagram indicates specific measurements for screw spacing, which appears to be 100 mm to 200 mm, depending on the application. The recommended screw installation angle is shown as a 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 angle, with a pull-through measurement for the screws being 60 to 70 mm.\n\n3. **Assembly Order or Installation Sequence**: The sequence involves driving screws at the specified angle and spacing into the truss members to ensure proper connection and load transfer.\n\n4. **Critical Details**: Important details include:\n   - Overlapping connections where trusses meet, ensuring a proper load path.\n   - Minimum clearances for screws relative to edges and other fasteners to avoid splitting the timber.\n   - Guidelines on gap allowances to accommodate wood movement. \n\nThis information highlights best practices for ensuring structural integrity when using these fasteners in mass timber constructions.\n\nPage context: .CNI YNAPMOC EIT-GNORTS NOSPMIS 3202\u00a9 32ZNUA-TM-C .CNI YNAPMOC EIT-GNORTS NOSPMIS 3202\u00a9 32ZNUA-TM-C Simpson Strong-Tie\u00ae Connectors & Fasteners for Mass Timber Construction \u2014 Australia & New Zealand St",

Simpson Strong\u2011Tie\u00ae offers a broad variety of stainless\u2011steel connectors designed to provide a superior level of protection and durability against corrosive environments and materials. Common Corrosive Factors That Can Negatively Affect Structural Connections \u2022 Ocean salt air \u2022 Pool or hot tub chemicals \u2022 Water \u2022 Fertilisers \u2022 Preservative\u2011treated timber \u2022 Soil \u2022 Fire retardant\u2011treated timber \u2022 Industrial zones \u2022 Salt used to de\u2011ice \u2022 Concrete or melt snow The Science Behind Stainless Steel Each Simpson Strong\u2011Tie\u00ae stainless\u2011steel connector is made with type 316L stainless steel. Because stainless steel contains nickel and chromium, stainless steel develops a thin layer of chromium oxide on the surface of the metal that protects the connector from corrosive attack. Type 316L stainless steel also includes molybdenum, which helps increase corrosion resistance chloride\u2011type areas, such as salt water environments. Type 316L has shown no visible sign of surface red rust after 1,000 hours of an ASTM B117 salt spray test. For more information about corrosion, visit www.strongtie.com/info.",

For more information about corrosion, visit www.strongtie.com/info. Always Use Stainless\u2011Steel Fasteners with Stainless\u2011Steel Connectors Even with the protection of stainless\u2011steel connections, structures in corrosive environments can be compromised over time when these connectors are installed with fasteners that are not stainless steel. Carbon\u2011steel fasteners with coatings such as hot\u2011dip galvanisation will corrode faster than the stainless\u2011steel connectors that they fasten. This can create a weak link that can eventually lead to failure. Likewise, fasteners made from a lower grade of stainless steel can also corrode at a faster rate than our type 316L stainless\u2011steel connectors. Type 316 stainless\u2011steel nails or screws protect the integrity of the structure and the investment made in stainless\u2011steel connectors. Simpson Strong\u2011Tie offers type 316 stainless\u2011steel nails and Strong\u2011Drive SDS screws that fasten our stainless\u2011steel connectors.

Designed to install on the formwork before the pour, they simplify concrete finishing and can easily adapt to timer stud interference. Designing with MASA mudsill anchors also eliminates the need for 75mm square plate washers on the anchor bolts for seismic design, and in some cases offers load capacities that meet or exceed the parallel\u2011 and perpendicular\u2011to\u2011plate shear capacity of other cast\u2011in\u2011place anchors. \u2022 Attaches easily to the concrete formwork. \u2022 Stays out of the way until needed, making slab finishing easier. \u2022 Eliminates the need to pre\u2011drill bottom plates for anchor bolts. \u2022 Adapts to timber stud placement with two installation scenarios.

Simpson Strong\u2011Tie stainless\u2011steel connectors require stainless\u2011steel fasteners. 11. Values in the table reflect installation into the wide face. 12. Holdowns and tension ties are for use in vertical or horizontal applications. 13. Holdowns and tension ties may be installed raised up to 460mm above the top of the concrete with no load reduction, provided that additional elongation of the anchor rod is taked into account.

Designed to install on hardened concrete with either a cast\u2011in\u2011place or post\u2011installed anchor, the ABU is designed to provide maximum uplift performance for areas where uplift from high winds is a concern. \u2022 The slotted base enables flexible positioning around the anchor bolt, making precise post placement easier. \u2022 The 25mm standoff meets code requirements and helps prevent rot at the end of the post in applications where weather or moisture are present. \u2022 ZMAX\u2122 galvanisation offers extra corrosion resistance for exterior and preservative\u2011treated timber applications. \u2022 The post can be fastened with either nail, bolts or Strong\u2011Drive\u00ae SD Connector screws. Material: See table on next page. Finish: Galvanised\u2014ZMAX\u00ae coating; ABU44SS, ABU66SS\u2014stainless steel. See Corrosion Information Installation \u2022 Use all specified fasteners. See General Notes. \u2022 See Anchoring and Fastening Systems for Concrete and Masonry for retrofit anchor options or reference technical bulletin T\u2011ANCHORSPEC. \u2022 Post bases do not provide adequate resistance to prevent members from rotating about the base and therefore are not recommended for non\u2011top supported installations (such as fences or unbraced carports).",

    "content": "DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION:\nBased on the construction detail/diagram, here's a concise technical analysis:\n\n1. **Components Shown**:\n   - **CJT Concealed Joist Tie**: A metal connector used for joining joists to beams.\n   - **Solid Sawn and Glulam Beams**: These are the primary structural elements being connected.\n   - **Fixings**: Includes screws or nails specified for securing the joist tie to the beams.\n\n2. **Key Measurements or Spacings**:\n   - Specific dimensions for the CJT are indicated, such as the size of the metal plate and required embedment depths for fixings.\n\n3. **Assembly Order or Installation Sequence**:\n   - The installation sequence typically includes:\n     1. Placing the CJT on the beam.\n     2. Aligning the joist with the CJT.\n     3. Fixing the joist and beam together using the specified fasteners.\n\n4. **Critical Details**:\n   - **Overlaps**: The tie should overlap sufficiently with both the beam and joist to ensure proper load transfer.\n   - **Gaps**: Ensure no significant gaps exist between the joist and the CJT for structural integrity.\n   - **Minimum Clearances**: Check for any stated minimum clearances to prevent moisture accumulation or interference with adjacent components. \n\nThis analysis is directed towards ensuring compliance with Australian/New Zealand construction standards and practices.\n\nPage context: 34 | Simpson Strong\u2011Tie\u00ae Timber Construction Connectors C\u2011C\u2011AU16 \u00a9 2016 Simpson Strong\u2011Tie Company Inc. sregnaH tsioJ maeB malulG dna nwaS diloS Concealed Joist Ties Solid Sawn and Glulam Beam Joist H",

Now one hanger can handle a wide range of framing applications. \u2022 All models are slope and skew adjustable on site. \u2022 Sizes for both solid sawn timber and engineered wood. Material: LSSU410 \u2013 1.6mm, all others 1.3mm. Finish: Galvanised. See Corrosion Information. Installation \u2022 Use all specified fasteners. See General Notes. \u2022 Verify that the header can take the fasteners specified in the table. \u2022 Attach the sloped joist at both ends so that the horizontal force developed by the slope is fully supported by the supporting members. \u2022 Watch an installation video; www.strongtie.com/videolibrary/con\u2011lssui.html. LSSU Typical Installation STEP 1: Nail hanger to slope\u2011cut carried member, STEP 2: Skew flange from 0\u201145\u00b0. Bend other STEP 3: Attach hanger to the carrying installing seat nail first. No bevel necessary for flange back along centreline of slots until it member, acute angle side first (see skewed installation. Install joist nails at 45\u00b0 angle. meets the header. Bend one time only. footnote 5). Install nails at an angle.",

Material: See table on next page. Finish: Galvanised. See Corrosion Information. Uplift Loads \u2022 Models have optional triangle joist nail holes for additional uplift. Properly attached web stiffeners are required. \u2022 See the load tables for minimum required fasteners and design uplift capacity. Installation \u2022 Use all specified fasteners. See General Notes. Verify that the header can take the required fasteners specified in the table. See more installation information. \u2022 For additional important installation information, see page 55. \u2022 Position I\u2011joist into hanger and snap into place. No joist nailing required.

With the ability to pull as much as 20mm of slack out of a single strap, the WBT can play an important role in reducing deflection in braced wall panels. It resists tension loads only and should be used in pairs (one of each X\u2011brace strap). \u2022 Can be used on bracing up to 32mm wide. \u2022 Includes tensioning bridge, bolt and nut. Material: 3mm thick. Finish: Galvanised. See Corrosion Information. Installation \u2022 Place WBT near centre of diagonal wall brace. \u2022 Install bolt through strap and WBT with nut facing towards the wall cavity. \u2022 Tightening the nut requires 10mm hex head deep socket setter. Tighten until the slack is taken out of the strap.

Design Capacity is the lesser of (1) the Characteristic Capacity multiplied by the Australian Capacity Factor, or the NZ Strength Reduction Factor (\u03c6), and applicable the k modification factors following AS 1720.1 and NZS 3603 and (2) the Serviceability Capacity which is the load at 3.2mm joint slip. Design Capacity is the minimum of test data and structural joint calculation. 2. For Australia, the Capacity Factor (\u03c6) is 0.85 for nails and screws for structural joints in a Category 1 application. Reduce tabulated values where other Category applications govern. For NZ, the Strength Reduction Factor (\u03c6) is 0.80 for nails in lateral loading. 3. Duration of Load Factor (k) is as shown. Reduce Duration of Load Factor where applicable.

The DTT1 is an easy\u2011to\u2011install method to provide a lateral\u2011load connection between the deck and the adjacent structure. The DTT2 can be used for the lateral\u2011load connection as well, but is ideal for the installation of guardrail posts that are able to resist the lateral forces that occur at the top of railing assemblies. \u2022 The DTT1Z provides a lateral connection from the outside of the house, eliminating the need to connect to joists inside the structure (which typically requires drywall removal). \u2022 The DTT2Z simplifies the building of safe, code\u2011compliant guard rails by anchoring the posts back into the deck framing for a more secure attachment. A stronger and more reliable connection than through bolting or lag screws, it is available ZMAX\u00ae galvanised or in stainless steel for maximum corrosion protection. \u2022 Both DTTs include the Strong\u2011Drive SDS\u00ae Heavy\u2011Duty Connector screws needed to attach to framing. The DTT2Z also includes a washer to place in the seat during installation. Material: 2mm thick. Finish: DTT1Z/DTT2Z galvanised\u2014ZMAX\u00ae coating; DTT2SS\u2014stainless steel.",

Here\u2019s a concise analysis based on typical components and information one might expect in such diagrams:\n\n1. **Components Shown**:\n   - **Pipe Grip Ties**: Metal connectors designed to secure timber members to steel posts.\n   - **Timber Members**: Likely represented as horizontal or vertical framing elements.\n   - **Steel Posts**: Vertical support structures for the outdoor installation.\n   - **Fixings**: Bolts, screws, or brackets used to attach the ties to the timber and steel.\n\n2. **Key Measurements or Spacings**:\n   - Specific measurements may vary, but typical spacing for ties or fastenings should be indicated, generally conforming to NZ/AU standards (e.g. maximum spacing between ties).\n\n3. **Assembly Order**:\n   - Installation sequence might involve first securing the steel post, then the timber members, followed by attaching the Pipe Grip Ties. Additionally, the proper order of loading and tightening fasteners would be noted.\n\n4. **Critical Details**:\n   - **Overlap and Gaps**: There may be specified overlaps for timber ends and allowances for movement or expansion.\n   - **Minimum Clearances**: Important to maintain appropriate spacing between timber and steel components to prevent moisture buildup and ensure ventilation.\n  \nThis information is indicative and should be confirmed against the actual diagram for precise technical guidance and\n\nPage context: 86 | Simpson Strong\u2011Tie\u00ae Timber Construction Connectors C\u2011C\u2011AU16 \u00a9 2016 Simpson Strong\u2011Tie Company Inc. serutcurtS roodtuO Outdoor Structures Typical Installation Field Bent Application PGT2Z\u2011R (PGT1.",

Structural connectors are made out of steel, and are engineered to connect and strengthen the frame of a building. Reinforcing the frame of a building with structural connectors helps the building resist damage caused by earthquakes, high winds and cyclones. Framing materials secured with connectors are much stronger than those secured only with nails (called toenailing). Connectors come in all shapes and sizes, and have a variety of names, such as joist hangers, holdowns and hurricane ties. Homeowners don\u2019t typically see connectors in their homes because they are covered up behind the walls. Crawl Space Perimeter Wall Rim Joist Floor System Top Plates A35 What is a shearwall?

To learn more, visit Build with a Continuous Load Path www.safestronghome.com/protect/02.asp When framing a house, why is it better to use connectors than the traditional practice of toenailing? Framing materials held together with structural connectors can withstand much stronger forces than those held together with nails. Connectors have a higher load capacity than nails (see example at right). In a high wind storm, for example, nails are much more likely to pull apart or pop out than a metal connector. A connection made with a metal connector can be pulled apart, but it takes much greater force to separate it than a simple toenailed connection. A building built with connectors is better Toenail connection load capacity: Connector load capacity: 1.30kN 4.7kN able to resist forces from high winds and earthquakes.

Simpson Strong\u2011Tie recommends inspecting your deck at least Well\u2011built decks made out of timber should last 10\u201315 years once a year. A good time to do this is the beginning of spring with proper inspection and maintenance. before you and your family start using your deck regularly. Can I repair my deck myself? A skilled homeowner can tackle most deck repair projects. However, if you\u2019re not handy in construction, Simpson Strong\u2011Tie highly recommends working with a qualified, professional home surveyor or structural engineer to perform a structural evaluation and then a licensed contractor to do the work for you. When hiring a design professional, you want to make sure they are licensed and have a good reputation. It\u2019s also a good idea to understand the work that is to be done and get involved in the process, so that you can make sure the project is done right.

Treatments for sawn products typical of Hazard Classes H4, H5, and H6 are CCA, ACZA, ACQ (retention > 6.4 kg/m3), and creosote. 5. Fire-retardant treated timber may have specific corrosion resistance requirements. See chemical manufacturer guidelines. 6. Type 316/305/304 stainless steels are recommended where preservative treated timber is used in ground contact. 7. Testing by Simpson Strong-Tie following ICC-ES AC257 has shown that mechanical galvanisation, Quik Guard coating, and Double Barrier coating will provide corrosion resistance equivalent to hot-dip galvanisation in contact with chemically treated timber in dry service and wet service exposures (Hazard Classes H1-H3) and will perform adequately subject to regular maintenance and periodic inspection. 8. Mechanical galvanisations C3 and N2000 should not be used in conditions that would be more corrosive than Hazard Class H3 (external, above ground rapid water run off). 9. If uncertain about Hazard Class, treatment chemical, or environment, use Type 316/305/304 stainless steels, silicon bronze, or copper. 10.

The 25 mm standoff, with black powder coat finish, reduces the potential for decay at the post end and satisfies code requirements for posts that are exposed to weather or water splash or are in basements. Finish: Knife plate, washers and standoff base ZMAX\u00ae coating. The 1/2\" (12.7 mm) diameter drift dowels are mechanically galvanised. If substituting M12 diameter bolts, a hot-dip galvanised finish is recommended. CPT4 also available in 316L SS. See Corrosion Information.

The DTT1 is an easy-to-install method to provide a lateral-load connection between the deck and the adjacent structure. The DTT2 can be used for the lateral-load connection as well, but is ideal for the installation of guardrail posts that are able to resist the lateral forces that occur at the top of railing assemblies.
