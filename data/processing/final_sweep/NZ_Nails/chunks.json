Gold passivated nails have been coated after manufacture with a passivate that is applied over the top of zinc coating to harden the surface (Gold in colour). Gold Passivated nails are intended for interior use only. Plated panel pin nails have been coated after manufacture with a zinc coating using the electroplating process. The panel pin head is a small jolt head used where concealment of the head is required. Plated panel pin nails are intended for interior use only. NZ Nail loose nail head types include: Flat Head nails have a large diameter head (normally up to 2.5 times the thickness of the nail shank). This head will sit slightly proud of the work surface. Flat head nails are designed to resist pull through on soft or thin timbers. This nail is used where the concealment of the head is not critical. Jolt Head nails have a small diameter head particularly suitable for applications where the head is required to be concealed. This head may be punched beneath the timber surface. Jolt head nails are designed to either finish flush with or below the work surface. Countersunk Head nails have a small diameter head particularly suitable for applications where the head is required to be less prominent or sit flush with the timber surface.",
