Typical NZSIP Smart Panels comprise of StrandBoard (SB) nominally 12mm thick foamed and bonded to a core of Polyurethane Insulation (PUR). Panels are nominally 1205mm wide with varying lengths and heights depending on the design location of the panel. Flexible roof and wall underlays must comply with NZBC Acceptable Solution E2/AS1 Table 23 or a breather-type membrane covered by a valid BRANZ Appraisal for use as a roof and wall underlays. Sealing tapes must be compatible with roof and wall underlays and SB substrate. Individual wall panels have a wall underlay vapour control layer adhered to the external face. The external wall envelope is clad over a drained cavity, the internal face is lined over a cavity to provide for electrical services. Roof Purlin Fixing. Roof purlins are 70mm x 45mm SG8 H1.2 and fixed using 8g x 75mm square drive stainless steel screws. The fixing spacing and purlin spacing can be selected for different wind zones using the relevant tables included in the technical literature in this document.",

Joints between adjacent panels are taped and foamed with Gorilla Pro Expanding foam A simple to use cam lock system quickly pulls the Smart Panels together during the construction process, making for an easy, fast install and a strong bond between each panel, allowing you to create an airtight SIPs building envelope. The continuous PUR insulation ensures that thermal bridging is kept to a minimum. Once the windows are installed \u2013 the Smart walls, roof and or floors provide a structure that is weather resistant and vapour permeable. Service channels and structural timber can be installed in the panels when and where required as each Smart Panel is custom manufactured for the home.

    "content": "BACKGROUND INFORMATION Innovation in the building industry over the last fifty years has focussed on improving the thermal performance of buildings, reducing building waste, using more lightweight materials and enabling faster methods of construction. First developed in the 1930\u2019s, Structural Insulated Panels (or SIPs) delivers all of these benefits and offers a real alternative to traditional timber framing. SIPs are a high-performance building system for low rise construction. They are manufactured under factory controlled conditions and can be fabricated to suit most building designs. The end result is a building system that is extremely strong, energy efficient and cost-effective Highly insulated and airtight, the Smart SIP Building System is an affordable, next- generation solution to building a comfortable, healthy, energy-efficient home.",

Once the wall panels have been erected the roof panels should be put on as soon as possible, preferably with the purlins and roof underlay and roofing, alternatively tarpaulins to mitigate the SB getting wet. If there is a delay in putting the wall underlay up then an assessment of the SB should be made before applying it. Although there is a notional 90 day exposure for the SB this should be kept to the absolute minimum if possible and the SB kept dry before installing the underlay. 1.5 Maintenance NZSIP Smartpanels must be kept dry after close-in. The external envelope must be maintained to prevent ingress of water and internal water sources such as leaks must be repaired promptly. If damage due to prolonged wetting does occur, contact NZSIP Limited for guidance with repair or replacement methods.

Roof spans longer than 3600mm should be reduced by employing additional lines of support in the form of beams or load bearing walls.Roof panels can be joined in the factory to create a longer span however this falls under SED At the other end of the scale, minimum panel sizes should be considered.

Also ensure there is sufficient space to form panels between windows and between windows and corners/other obstructions. Normally we recommend at least 300mm. If less space is required, please note that the supplied panels may be solid timber, or we may recommend a supporting timber post is installed onsite. Engineering To resolve all structural requirements for a project, engage an engineer as soon as possible in the design process. When it is practical and cost effective, structural components (such as timber beam pockets and posts) can be included in the panel manufacture. Steelwork We recommend that any steel structure (beams, columns or portals) be located to the interior of the building, as opposed to inline, or in the same plane as the panels. This eliminates any potential thermal bridging and condensation issues and ensures construction sequence flows smoothly. If steelwork within the panels is being considered, discuss with NZSIP prior to inclusion in documentation.

A key component of this system is the sealing of all internal panel joints and penetrations with compatible air sealing products. Air sealing tapes, adhesives and pipe and cable sealing grommets are to be installed to the inside face of structural insulated wall and roof panels at all joint and penetration locations. All aspects of this work shall be in accordance with the standard details and manufacturers instructions. Walls panels \u25cf Panel joints - all junctions between wall panels, headers, footers & gables, \u25cf corner junctions - all internal and external corners \u25cf floor junctions - ensure coverage of packing under bottom plate and seal to concrete for concrete slab floors \u25cf window and door openings \u25cf service penetrations - ensure all penetrations are completed at the pre lining stage Roof panels \u25cf Panel joints - all junction between roof panels \u25cf Ridge & beam junctions - ensure full coverage of beams, including joint between built up members and pocket to wall panels. \u25cf Gable and eave junctions - ensure coverage of timber wedge at eave. \u25cf Roof light openings \u25cf service penetrations - ensure all penetrations are completed at the pre lining stage 5.6 Blower door testing As a check on the quality of construction, we recommend blower door testing at the pre-lining stage.",

Construction sites can contain multiple hazards and it is essential that installers follow all legal requirements when working on site. Please refer to the OSH regulations for all relevant legislation. The Smart Panel instal manual outlines specific handling and installation of panels and recommends tools and accessories. 6. Bracing Design 6.1 Bracing Criteria Bracing unit requirements for wind and earthquake are determined by using the design criteria from Section 5 of NZS 3604:2011. The bracing resistance of the building may be calculated by adding the bracing unit values of each panel type. All full height panels, without large openings, and a min. length of 1.2m, may be used as bracing elements.",

Shower Areas \u2013 These are areas subject to frequent and heavy water splash such as enclosed showers, unenclosed shower zones and showers over baths.

In addition, shower areas must be waterproofed. This can be achieved using proprietary rigid shower lining systems, flexible vinyl shower wall finish, or tiling. Tiled shower areas must include a wet area waterproofing membrane system under the tiles. 17.1 Ventilation The typical NZSIP Smart Panel construction creates an airtight, energy efficient building envelope. Due to the inherent airtightness of the NZSIP Smart Panel Building System some permanent ventilation, not reliant on window openings, must be provided in wet areas, such as bathrooms and laundries. The Technical Literature contains details for how this may be achieved. Vented windows, wall or ceiling mounted extract fans, or similar fittings are recommended in all building wet areas. Extract fans for moisture laden air must be vented externally. Due to the airtight performance of the NZSIP type construction, the use of mechanical ventilation is required. It is recommended that the minimum design ventilation rate of 0.35ach but no less than 7.5l/s person. (ASHRAE 62-1999) Natural ventilation must also be provided with the minimum area of openable window as 5% of the floor area in each room.",
