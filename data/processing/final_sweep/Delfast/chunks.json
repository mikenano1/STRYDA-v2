Durability 8.1 Delfast Nails are expected to have a serviceable life of at least 15 or 50 years (depending on their use) provided that they are installed and maintained in accordance with this Appraisal. 8.2 Table 3 gives information on where each of the types of Delfast Nails identified in Table 1 may be used based on the timber use, the environment, the timber moisture content and the timber treatment. Table 3 is for Corrosion Zone B as defined by NZS 3604. Table 4 gives the same information for Corrosion Zones C and D as defined by NZS 3604. 8.3 If ACQ-based or CuAz-based treatments are used for timber hazard classes H3.2, H4 or H5, then only stainless steel fasteners should be used in exposed or sheltered locations in accordance with NZS 3604, Clause 4.4.4. There is very little of these timber treatments in use in New Zealand at this time, and most timber is treated with CCA.

    "content": "Supporting the industries at the heart of New Zealand since \u201992. Rural, construction, and manufacturing are all industries at the heart of New Zealand. Working in New Zealand\u2019s climate and landscapes is unique and has its own challenges, but we\u2019re proud to be kiwis. It shapes our family, and it shapes our brand. Grandpa was farming since high school, but in 1964 he made the decision to sell the farm to better support his family. Grandpa then moved his family to Palmerston North, where he developed his sales skills. In 1992, Delfast was started by Grandpa\u2019s sons, Andrew and Ian. Through the relationships we\u2019ve built with our end-users, we\u2019ve been able to develop over 1000 product lines that are ideally suited to our end-users\u2019 needs. A pivotal point for Delfast was when we saw a need for a better fencing product than what was on the local market. So in 1998, we developed a contractors stapler that changed fencing forever; a product that would last and worked with New Zealand\u2019s unique conditions. Grandpa\u2019s commitment to people has remained a key part of who we are. Our goal is to create an environment where people are confident to own the Delfast products they have. To think smarter, not harder for our end-users; to make building the best, effortlessly. 2",
