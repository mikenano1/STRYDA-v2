COMPANY DETAILS Name Tasman Insulation Ltd T/A Comfortech\u00ae Building Performance Solutions Role Manufacturer NZBN 9429037894139 Address 9-15 Holloway Place, Penrose, Auckland 1061 Website www.pinkbatts.co.nz Email technicalsupport@comfortech.co.nz Phone 0800 454 000 DESCRIPTION OF BUILDING PRODUCT Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae are a non-combustible, flexible glass wool thermal insulation. The batts are intended for use in walls, underfloor and ceilings including skillion roofs, and in conjunction timber and steel framing or part framing. Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae batts are manufactured from at least 80% recycled glass which is spun into small fibres and then combined with a binder (urea extended phenolic resin) into a mat form. Millions of tiny air pockets are created that trap the air. These air pockets make Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae a poor conductor of heat, i.e. provide excellent thermal resistance. Thermal resistance (R-value) is a measure of how well a material resists the conduction of heat. It is determined by the thickness and density of the insulation. Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae are supplied in a range of thicknesses and densities to provide a range of R-values.",

    "content": "SAFETY FACT SHEET #1 UNDERSTANDING WHAT GOES INTO PINK\u00ae BATTS\u00ae GLASS WOOL INSULATION. Let\u2019s look more closely at the binder. Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae insulation uses a Phenol-formaldehyde (PF) binder. There\u2019s been lots of misinformation about the safety of free formaldehyde in our finished products, so here are the facts. Formaldehyde is a naturally occurring compound that\u2019s part of the decomposition process. This means that there literally is formaldehyde in every living thing on earth. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen (causes cancer) which is why it\u2019s one of the excluded compounds on the Living Building Challenge Red List. However, this is only of concern when we\u2019re exposed to levels of formaldehyde in concentrations that are too high for our bodies to metabolise. Formaldehyde emissions from Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae glass wool insulation are around 0.020 \u2013 0.040 ppm, lower than the limit for GREENGUARD Certification (a rigorous and comprehensive international standard for low emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into indoor air) and well below the Worksafe New Zealand Permissible Workplace Exposure limit. Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae glass wool insulation is GREENGUARD certified. Numerous studies1 have been completed on formaldehyde in building products. They\u2019ve found that installing glass wool insulation had an effect almost too small to measure on the levels of formaldehyde present (see chart below). Once construction\u2019s completed, there\u2019s a steady decrease in formaldehyde levels.",

The process of cutting Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae insulation into segments creates rough edges on the ends of the segments. Rubbing against these cut fibres may irritate some people\u2019s skin. Due to the brittleness of the fibres, the cutting process also creates dust. This can settle on your skin and may irritate it. Both are uncomfortable but, in the quantities you\u2019re exposed to when installing Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae insulation, neither pose any danger or long-term health effects. Any irritation to the skin is harmless and temporary. Finer fibre = less irritation. As technology has improved, we\u2019ve been able to reduce the fibre size we use in Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae to increase comfort when handling the product. Minimising dust irritation. We test our product on a regular basis across a range of criteria, including dust. From time-to-time we\u2019ll also buy competitor product and test that using the same methods.

We recommend: loose fitting work clothes which cover the arms and legs covered shoes dust mask safety glasses. * Refers specifically to the insulation instalment, and not other factors on site. So why do we make our product out of glass? Three factors make it a great insulation product, and far outweigh the harmless and temporary skin irritation it may cause: it\u2019s a cost effective material - especially when compared to alternative insulation materials it performs well - when spun into a fine fibre it isn\u2019t very conductive and you can fit an enormous number of fibres in a given cavity size. This severely limits convective heat transfer across a wall or ceiling. To a lesser degree, glass is also reflective which means that infrared radiation (heat) bounces back off it toward the source glass is environmentally responsible - compared to plastic products that are derived from oil. pinkbatts.co.nz This data sheet may have been superseded.

    "content": "SAFETY FACT SHEET #3 UNDERSTANDING THE SAFETY OF PINK\u00ae BATTS\u00ae GLASS WOOL INSULATION. What happens if glass wool fibres are inhaled? Our minimum average fibre diameter is around 5 microns. WorkSafe New Zealand guidelines define a respirable fibre as one that has a diameter less than 3 microns and a length greater than 5 microns. That means that it\u2019s very unlikely that any glass wool fibres breathed in during the installation of our products will make their way into your lungs. They\u2019ll either get removed via mechanical processes (i.e. you\u2019ll cough them out) or they\u2019ll dissolve in the lungs (see \u2018biosolubility\u2019 below). But what happens if a respirable fibre does makes its way to the deepest part of the lung? In the unlikely event that this happens, mechanical processes (coughing etc.) will not extract it. However, to be considered biosoluble, glass wool fibres need to be made to comply with note Q in European Commission Directive 97/69/EC2. Note Q is attached to the classification of Synthetic Mineral Fibres (SMF), a group that includes glass wool, to identify tests required to ensure that fibres are biosoluble. Biosoluble fibres are not considered to be hazardous substances. Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae glass wool fibres are type NK8340. Glass wool fibres of type NK8340 meet the exoneration criteria of Note Q and are therefore not hazardous. 2.

    "content": "SAFETY FACT SHEETS #3 UNDERSTANDING THE SAFETY OF PINK\u00ae BATTS\u00ae GLASS WOOL INSULATION. What is biosolubility? Biosolubility is the measure of a substance\u2019s ability to dissolve in bodily fluids. The opposite expression of this is biopersistence (can\u2019t be broken down by the body). Biosolubility is measured in terms of half-time, i.e. how long does it take for half of the fibre to dissolve? Glass wool fibres have a half-time of around 9 days. Why is biosolubility important? Biosoluble fibres are not considered to be hazardous substances. This is important because of what happens if a fibre can\u2019t be broken down. The worst-case scenario is that the fibre persists perpetually as is the case with asbestos. The half-time of asbestos fibres (i.e. their biopersistence) can be up to 7-8 years3. During that time the fibres sit in the lungs causing scarring known as asbestosis that, in turn, inhibits the ability of your lungs to transfer oxygen to your blood stream. Asbestosis can also lead to lung cancer. 3. https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/work-related-health/monitoring/exposure-standards-and-biological-exposure-indices/ How do we know that glass wool isn\u2019t the next asbestos? There\u2019s about 80 years\u2019 worth of research on glass wool \u2013 dating right back to its invention in the 1930s. All modern glass wool from reputable manufacturers is made to meet a minimum biosolubility requirement.",

All modern glass wool from reputable manufacturers is made to meet a minimum biosolubility requirement. We regularly send product overseas for accredited independent testing to make sure that our glass wool meets these requirements. This combination of extensive research and proven biosolubility means that glass wool is currently classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as Group 3 \u2013 not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. This is the same classification as tea and coffee. By comparison, asbestos is not biosoluble and is classified by IARC as Group 1 - carcinogenic to humans. So are there no health effects from inhaling glass wool fibres? There is the possibility of some irritation to the respiratory system. Potential symptoms can include a sore throat and cough. While uncomfortable, these symptoms are temporary, harmless and easily treated. pinkbatts.co.nz This data sheet may have been superseded.

Potential effects include fish mortality, forest decline, and the deterioration of building materials. Eutrophication potential (EP-freshwater, EP-marine, EP-terrestrial) Eutrophication covers all potential impacts of excessively high levels of macronutrients, the most important of which are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). In aquatic ecosystems where this term is mostly applied, this typically describes a degradation in water quality. Eutrophication can result in an undesirable change in the type of species that flourish and an increase in the production of biomass.

Photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) Photochemical ozone formation potential gives an indication of the emissions from precursors that contribute to ground level smog formation, mainly ozone (O3). Ground level ozone may be harmful to human health and ecosystems and may also damage crops. These emissions are produced by the reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide in the presence of nitrogen oxides and UV light. Abiotic resource depletion (ADP-mm, ADP-fossil) The consumption of non-renewable resources decreases the availability of these resources and their associated functions in the future.

It excludes biogenic carbon and indirect radiative forcing. 3 This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator. 4 The results of the impact categories abiotic depletion of minerals and metals, land use, human toxicity (cancer), human toxicity, non-cancer and ecotoxicity (freshwater) may be highly uncertain in LCAs that include capital goods/infrastructure in generic datasets, in case infrastructure/capital goods contribute greatly to the total results. This is because the LCI data of infrastructure/capital goods used to quantify these indicators in currently available generic datasets sometimes lack temporal, technological and geographical representativeness. Caution should be exercised when using the results of these indicators for decision-making purposes. 5 The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experience with the indicator. 26 Comfortech\u00ae | Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION 27",

Potential effects include fish mortality, forest decline, and the deterioration of building materials. Eutrophication potential (EP-freshwater, EP-marine, EP-terrestrial) Eutrophication covers all potential impacts of excessively high levels of macronutrients, the most important of which are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). In aquatic ecosystems where this term is mostly applied, this typically describes a degradation in water quality. Eutrophication can result in an undesirable change in the type of species that flourish and an increase in the production of biomass.

Ground level ozone may be harmful to human health and ecosystems and may also damage crops. These emissions are produced by the reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide in the presence of nitrogen oxides and UV light. Abiotic resource depletion (ADP-mm, ADP-fossil) The consumption of non-renewable resources decreases the availability of these resources and their associated functions in the future.

It excludes biogenic carbon and indirect radiative forcing. 3 This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator. 4 The results of the impact categories abiotic depletion of minerals and metals, land use, human toxicity (cancer), human toxicity, non-cancer and ecotoxicity (freshwater) may be highly uncertain in LCAs that include capital goods/infrastructure in generic datasets, in case infrastructure/capital goods contribute greatly to the total results. This is because the LCI data of infrastructure/capital goods used to quantify these indicators in currently available generic datasets sometimes lack temporal, technological and geographical representativeness. Caution should be exercised when using the results of these indicators for decision-making purposes. 5 The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experience with the indicator. 26 Comfortech\u00ae | Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION 27",

A molecule\u2019s acidification potential indicates its capacity to increase the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration in the presence of water, thus decreasing the pH value. Potential effects include fish mortality, forest decline, and the deterioration of building materials. Eutrophication potential (EP-freshwater, EP-marine, EP-terrestrial) Eutrophication covers all potential impacts of excessively high levels of macronutrients, the most important of which are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). In aquatic ecosystems where this term is mostly applied, this typically describes a degradation in water quality. Eutrophication can result in an undesirable change in the type of species that flourish and an increase in the production of biomass. As the decomposition of biomass consumes oxygen, eutrophication may decrease the available oxygen level in the water column and threaten fish in their ability to respire.",

As the decomposition of biomass consumes oxygen, eutrophication may decrease the available oxygen level in the water column and threaten fish in their ability to respire. Photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) Photochemical ozone formation potential gives an indication of the emissions from precursors that contribute to ground level smog formation, mainly ozone (O3). Ground level ozone may be harmful to human health and ecosystems and may also damage crops. These emissions are produced by the reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide in the presence of nitrogen oxides and UV light. Abiotic resource depletion (ADP-mm, ADP-fossil) The consumption of non-renewable resources decreases the availability of these resources and their associated functions in the future. Depletion of mineral resources and non-renewable energy resources are reported separately. Depletion of mineral resources is assessed based on total reserves. Water use (WDP) Water scarcity is a measure of the stress on a region due to water consumption. 20 Comfortech\u00ae | Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION 21",

It excludes biogenic carbon and indirect radiative forcing. 3 This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator. 4 The results of the impact categories abiotic depletion of minerals and metals, land use, human toxicity (cancer), human toxicity, non-cancer and ecotoxicity (freshwater) may be highly uncertain in LCAs that include capital goods/infrastructure in generic datasets, in case infrastructure/capital goods contribute greatly to the total results. This is because the LCI data of infrastructure/capital goods used to quantify these indicators in currently available generic datasets sometimes lack temporal, technological and geographical representativeness. Caution should be exercised when using the results of these indicators for decision-making purposes. 5 The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experience with the indicator. 26 Comfortech\u00ae | Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION 27",

This is because economy and aligns with ISO 59020 (ISO, 2024). It measures the the proportion of recycled crushed degree to which a product system keeps materials in circulation glass in the product decreases as the at their highest form of value. It provides a common metric binder content increases. Generally, that applies to all of the different circular economy strategies the greater the quantity of recycled including avoidance, durability, reuse, remanufacturing, crushed glass in the product the higher recycling, regenerative sourcing, composting and energy the MCI.

Values between R2.6 Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae SnugFloor\u00ae Wide 0.436 37.4% 0 and 0.1 are reserved for products that consume more material, typically due to a lower utility than an average product.

The MCI has been reported as here both an MCI Score and a percentage circularity (% MCI) to support comparability.

This means that the production (modules A1- A3), end-of-life (C1-C4) and recovery (D) stages are modelled in this EPD. The construction process (modules A4-A5) and use stages (B1-B7) are not modelled. These life cycle stages are dependent on particular scenarios and best modelled at the building or construction level. The processes below are included in the product system to be studied. For modules beyond A3, the scenarios included are currently in use and are representative for one of the most probable alternatives. MODULE A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 B1-B7 C1-C4 D PRODUCT STAGE EXCLUDED STAGES END-OF-LIFE RECOVERY Raw materials, transport, manufacturing Construction, use Removal, disposal Recycling, reuse The production stage (Modules A1-A3) includes all aspects of Comfortech\u00ae insulation production from cradle to gate, utilising elementary and product flows.

This means that the production (modules A1- A3), end-of-life (C1-C4) and recovery (D) stages are modelled in this EPD. The construction process (modules A4-A5) and use stages (B1-B7) are not modelled. These life cycle stages are dependent on particular scenarios and best modelled at the building or construction level. The processes below are included in the product system to be studied. For modules beyond A3, the scenarios included are currently in use and are representative for one of the most probable alternatives.

Seek medical advice. Inhalation If inhaled, remove from contaminated area to fresh air. Skin Wash with mild soap and running water. Use a washcloth if necessary to help remove fibres and particles. Ingestion Give water to drink. Medical Advice If symptoms persist seek medical advice. Treat symptomatically. SECTION 5 : FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES Flammability Glass wool insulation is stable and similar products are used for fire proofing purposes. During a fire, however, the packaging and some facings may burn and the resin binding the fibres may break down producing gases typical of any organic material being burnt in a fire. Fire and Explosion Non-flammable. Not Explosive. Extinguishing Normal fire fighting. Hazchem Code None allocated. SECTION 6 : ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Spillage Any spilt material due to accidents or off-cuts from installation should be cleaned up by the use of a vacuum cleaner or sweeping.

Engineering Controls Provide good ventilation (either forced or natural). Minimise dust generation by using hand tools. Powered tools and machinery (e.g. saws, sanders, drills) should be fitted with dust extraction equipment. An industrial vacuum cleaner should be used to clean work areas. PPE Loose fitting work clothes which cover the arms, neck and legs are recommended for comfort. Work gloves are also recommended. Use a half-face respirator (minimum class P1) when exposure is above WES limit, and at levels below WES limit if desired for comfort (refer to Worksafe list of approved Respiratory Protection Equipment). In very dusty conditions greater comfort may be afforded by a full-face powered air-purifying respirator. Ventilated, non-fogging goggles are also recommended particularly when handling glasswool overhead. Wash regularly and launder work clothes separately from other clothes.",

However the product can contain fibres ranging from one to twenty \u03bcm diameter. The manufacturing process for bonded glass wool involves the heat curing of the resin to form a yellow/pink/green binder which bonds the fibres. Solvent refined mineral de-dusting oils (usually less than 1%) are added during manufacture. Testing of this product during use indicates that airborne respirable fibre levels of less than 0.2 f/mL can be anticipated.

The itch or rash is usually not severe, does not last long, and can be relieved by washing with mild soap and cool water. \u2022 Ingestion: Unlikely to occur and no known health effects but would be expected to cause stomach irritation if ingested. CHRONIC (Long Term): There are no long-term health effects. This product is rapidly bio-soluble in laboratory studies. Bio-soluble means that any fibres inhaled into the lungs dissolve in the body fluids and are quickly cleared from the lungs. The fibres comply with the short term biopersistence test in Note Q in European Directive 97/69/EC of 5 Dec 1997.

The following design factors should be considered to ensure your roof\u2019s performance and durability. Internal moisture and condensation \u2022 To prevent internal moisture entering the roof space, use vapour resistant lining in wet areas such as kitchens and bathrooms (e.g. gloss/oil based paint systems) \u2022 Reduce airflow into the roof cavity through ceiling linings that are resistant to airflow (e.g. for a tongue and groove ceiling) by using a breather type air barrier \u2022 Reduce penetrations through ceilings e.g. use sealed recessed downlights \u2022 Special situations: Ski lodges, indoor pools/spas, cold stores may require an additional fully sealed vapour barrier Ventilation \u2022 A minimum 25mm clearance between the top of the insulation and the building underlay is required to provide a minimum amount of ventilation and reduce moisture build up in the roof cavity .

The most effective way to protect the bottom plate was a strip of kraft paper tucked into the gap between the framing and the back of the cladding. Therefore, prior to installing the insulation, our recommendation is to fit an underlay with a water-repellent drainage plane mesh (Dupont Tyvek Metal) into the back of the cavity cut to the size of the opening and use the whole framing cavity. For further information please refer to Build 199 \u2013 49 (Dec/Jan 2024). BRANZ further advise that, since some existing framing is only 95mm depth (or occasionally 90mm depth), the specific insulation product needs to be chosen to match the framing depth and the installation process. For example, with a 90mm frame depth a suitable product would need to have a thickness of 83mm or less to allow the lining to be correctly installed. We don\u2019t currently manufacture a 83mm thickness product. Therefore, for a 90mm frame Pink\u00ae Batts\u00ae R2.2 70mm product should be used. b) Drained Cavity \u2022 The insulation can be the same thickness as the frame.",

    "content": "Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae Ceiling Insulation Installation Instructions Clearances For determining clearances, refer to NZS 4246:2016 Energy Efficiency \u2013 Installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings. Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae Installation Guide Insulation Guard If an insulation guard is in place, this will allow compression of the Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae to a minimum of halfway or more across the top plate. On lower pitched roofs, or if there is no insulation guard, a thinner product may need to be installed above the top plate. This is to ensure a minimum of 25mm air gap between insulation and roofing underlay. It is important to note the insulation guard must be fitted as part of the roof install, not as part of the insulation install. A minimum of R3.3 construction R-value is required for the last 500mm of the ceiling perimeter. Single Layer Installation Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae products are designed so they can be cut to fit over the bottom truss chord with trusses at 900mm centres. Comfortech\u00ae recommend notching one side of the Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae as illustrated in Figure 1, this ensures that there is insulation above the truss cord, and heat loss is mitigated as there is no thermal bridge. To notch the product, cut to the same width as the truss chord and adjust the depth in accordance with the depth of your truss bottom chord.",

    "content": ", and heat loss is mitigated as there is no thermal bridge. To notch the product, cut to the same width as the truss chord and adjust the depth in accordance with the depth of your truss bottom chord. You will need to notch one of the two Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae that fit between each truss, installing the notched Batt\u00ae over the truss with the second Pink\u00ae Superbatt\u00ae to butt up against the side of the next truss under slight compression. To achieve the required construction R-value of R3.3 at the ceiling perimeter (last 500mm), a minimum product R-value of R3.5* and a minimum 115mm height is required at the midpoint of the top plate to the underside of the insulation guard, to accommodate the compressed insulation. If the roof slope is less than 20 degrees, a raised heel will be required on the truss. *Testing has shown that the full Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae ceiling range achieves the required perimeter construction R-value under compression. Double layer Installation In some situations, a double layer insulation solution may be specified or required. Comfortech\u00ae recommend the top layer install be started first, with the bottom layer being installed underneath it. The top layer is to be run uninterrupted across the trusses, and the bottom layer to be installed in between the trusses (Figure 2).",

Therefore, the first 460mm of ceiling perimeter insulation utilises a single layer of the higher R-value product (the top layer).

    "content": "To meet the H1 insulation changes, Comfortech\u00ae have collaborated with key industry stakeholders to lead the way with a range of residential solutions that specifically address thermal bridging, delivering optimal outcomes for energy efficient homes. Single-layer solution For residential ceilings, our single- layer solution includes our Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae R7.0 at the new width of 460mm, where segments can be notched and fitted around the truss chord to seal the thermal bridge. Double-layer solution Our double-layer solution uses a first layer of high-density Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae insulation of 110mm or 140mm thickness, to match the chord height. The second layer uses our Pink\u00ae Superbatts\u00ae R4.5, installed at right angles to the first layer, with this method, the thermal bridge is completely closed. A lower R-value second layer can also be selected where another compliance pathway method has been chosen. ROF SNOITULOS ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES R7.0 @ 460mm Other R-values available @460mm Notch (cut on site) to cover truss chord R4.5 @ 210mm or as required R2.6 @ 110mm (for 90mm truss chords) Also, R3.0 @ 160mm (for 140mm truss chords)",
