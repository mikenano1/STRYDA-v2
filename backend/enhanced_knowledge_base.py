            - Wash work clothes separately
            
            Common Installation Errors:
            - Compressing insulation reduces R-value significantly
            - Leaving gaps allows thermal bridging
            - Installing wrong way up (underfloor)
            - Blocking ventilation pathways
            - Insufficient clearance to heat sources
            
            Building Code Compliance:
            - Installation must achieve minimum R-values for climate zone
            - Thermal bridging must be addressed
            - Condensation control may require vapor barriers
            - Fire separation requirements in roof spaces
            
            Performance Factors:
            - Moisture reduces insulation effectiveness
            - Air gaps significantly reduce performance
            - Thermal bridging through framing
            - Installation quality affects long-term performance

            NZS 4230:2004 Reinforced Concrete Masonry Design
            
            Scope and Application:
            Covers design of reinforced concrete masonry structures including:
            - Residential and commercial buildings
            - Retaining walls and boundary walls
            - Seismic design requirements
            - Material specifications
            
            Material Requirements:
            
            Concrete Masonry Units:
            - Minimum compressive strength: 15 MPa (residential)
            - Higher strengths required for commercial: 20-30 MPa
            - Units must comply with AS/NZS 4455.1
            - Shrinkage movement considerations
            
            Mortar Specifications:
            - Type M mortar: General purpose (10 MPa minimum)
            - Type S mortar: High strength (15 MPa minimum) 
            - Type N mortar: Medium strength (5 MPa minimum)
            - Plasticizer use affects bond strength
            
            Reinforcing Steel:
            - Grade 300E deformed bars (residential)
            - Grade 500E for higher loads
            - Minimum cover: 15mm internal, 25mm external
            - Lap lengths vary with bar diameter and grade
            
            Structural Design Requirements:
            
            Wall Design:
            - Slenderness limits for unreinforced masonry
            - Reinforcement requirements for height/thickness ratios
            - Control joint spacing: 6m maximum
            - Openings require lintels sized for loads
            
            Seismic Design:
            - Masonry structures must be designed for earthquake loads
            - Ductile detailing required in high seismic zones
            - Special reinforcement at wall intersections
            - Ties between masonry and other materials
            
            Foundation Requirements:
            - Starter bars from foundation must lap with wall reinforcement
            - Minimum foundation width: wall thickness plus 100mm
            - Damp-proof course required between foundation and masonry
            - Expansion joints aligned through foundation
            
            Construction Requirements:
            
            Workmanship Standards:
            - Full bedding of mortar joints required
            - Head joints must be filled completely
            - No partial grouting permitted in reinforced masonry
            - Weather protection during construction
            
            Grouting Requirements:
            - Grout must be fluid consistency for placement
            - Lift heights limited to 1.2m maximum
            - Consolidation required to eliminate voids
            - Grout strength minimum 15 MPa at 28 days
            
            Quality Control:
            - Mortar cube testing required
            - Grout cylinder testing required  
            - Reinforcement placement inspection
            - Prism testing for masonry strength verification
            
            Common Design Issues:
            - Inadequate connection to other structural elements
            - Insufficient reinforcement for seismic loads
            - Thermal movement not accommodated
            - Moisture penetration through mortar joints
